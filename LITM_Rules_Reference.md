# Legend in the Mist - Rules Reference

This document contains the essential rules for Legend in the Mist, extracted from the Core Book v1.01. It covers player themes, hero actions, complications, the main game loop, statuses, tags, and all other mechanics needed to build content for the system.

---

## Core Concepts

### The Game Loop

The game is played as a conversation. Each scene repeats a three-step cycle:

1. **ESTABLISH**: The Narrator presents the scene:
   - Where the Heroes are and what is happening
   - What the stakes are (why it matters)
   - What the Challenges are (obstacles in the way)
   - What Threats are posed
   - Then asks: "What do you do?"

2. **ACTION**: The Hero in the spotlight describes their action. The Narrator determines the outcome using one of three methods: Simple, Quick, or Detailed.

3. **CONSEQUENCES**: Negative Consequences occur if:
   - You ignored a Threat
   - Your roll generated Consequences
   - The Narrator invokes your weakness tags

This cycle repeats. When all Heroes have acted, that's a **round**. The scene ends when stakes are won, lost, or deferred.

### Challenges

Challenges are characters, obstacles, and forces that oppose the Heroes. They:
- Act by making **Threats** during Establish
- Deliver **Consequences** if Threats are not stopped
- Have **Limits** (thresholds for being overcome)
- Are overcome by successful actions that meet or exceed their Limits

---

## Tags

Tags are short descriptors (1-3 words) that define important details. They have a dual role:
1. Define what's true in the story
2. Add or reduce Power from actions

**All tags are worth 1 Power** (or -1 if hindering).

### Types of Tags

| Tag Type | Description | Usage |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Power Tags** | Permanent Hero tags describing something useful | Cannot be used against you (usually) |
| **Weakness Tags** | Permanent Hero tags describing limitations | Cannot be used in your favor; when invoked, mark Improve |
| **Story Tags** | Temporary tags gained during play | Can be helpful or hindering; expire when no longer relevant |
| **Single-Use Tags** | Story tags that are scratched after one use | Cost 1 Power to create; cannot be burned |

### Scratched Tags

A scratched power tag becomes unavailable until recovered (through action or rest). A scratched story tag is removed entirely. Weakness tags cannot usually be scratched.

### Using Tags

- **Invoke** relevant tags when counting Power
- **Burn** a power/story tag: Scratch it to gain +3 Power instead of +1 (once per action)
- Tags can be **Direct** (immediately relevant) or **Indirect** (require a prep action first)

---

## Themes

Each Hero has **four themes**. Each theme contains:
- A **title tag** (the theme's name)
- 2-3 additional **power tags**
- 1 **weakness tag**
- A **Quest** (personal goal related to the theme)
- Trackers for **Improve**, **Milestone**, and **Abandon**

### Theme Types by Might Level

**Origin (Ordinary)**
- Circumstance, Devotion, Past, People, Personality, Skill or Trade, Trait

**Adventure (Exceptional)**
- Duty, Influence, Knowledge, Prodigious Ability, Relic, Uncanny Being

**Greatness (World-Shaping)**
- Destiny, Dominion, Mastery, Monstrosity

**Variable Might**
- Companion, Magic, Possessions

### Theme Development

| Tracker | When to Mark | At 3 Marks |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **Improve** | Weakness tag invoked; or Reflect during camp | Theme gains an Improvement |
| **Milestone** | Significant achievement toward Quest | Theme **Evolves** (transforms) |
| **Abandon** | Ignore or act against Quest | Theme is **Replaced** (new nascent theme) |

### Improvements (at 3 Improve)

Choose one:
- Create a new power tag
- Remove or add a weakness tag
- Gain a Special Improvement (theme-specific)
- Reset Abandon/Milestone trackers
- Mark Promise

You may also rewrite/update one tag when improving.

### Evolving a Theme (at 3 Milestones)

1. Mark Promise
2. Pick a new title tag
3. Choose a new theme type or change Might level
4. Revise tags as needed
5. Revise Quest
6. Trade old extras for Improvements

### Replacing a Theme (at 3 Abandon)

1. Mark Promise
2. Mark Promise again for each extra power tag, weakness tag, or Special Improvement
3. Discard the old theme
4. Create a **nascent theme**: title tag only, plus weakness and Quest
5. Next two times you'd mark Improve, add a power tag instead

---

## Actions and Outcomes

### Simple Outcome

The Narrator decides the outcome based on the situation, tags, and story logic. Used when:
- The outcome is certain
- The action isn't dramatic enough for dice

### Quick Outcome

Roll dice to determine Success or Consequences.

**Counting Power:**
- +1 Power per helpful tag
- -1 Power per hindering tag
- +tier of highest helpful status
- -tier of highest hindering status

**Roll:** 2d6 + Power

| Total | Result |
|-------|--------|
| 10+ | Success, no Consequences |
| 7-9 | Success AND Consequences |
| 6- | Consequences, no Success |

**Special Rolls:**
- Double 1s: Always Consequences without Success
- Double 6s: Always Success without Consequences

### Detailed Outcome

Roll as in Quick. On Success, **spend your Power** on Effects.

**Rule of Minimum One**: You always have at least 1 Power to spend on Success.

---

## Spending Power (Effects)

When you succeed in a Detailed action or reaction:

| Effect | Cost |
|--------|------|
| Add/give/recover a tag | 2 Power |
| Scratch a tag | 2 Power |
| Give a status | 1 Power per tier |
| Reduce a status | 1 Power per tier |
| Discover a valuable detail | 1 Power |
| Extra feat | 1 Power (after main purpose) |

### Common Uses of Effects

**Against Opponents:**
- Attack (give harmful status: wounded, cursed)
- Disrupt (give hindering tag/status: blinded, tangled)
- Influence (give compelling status: convinced, beguiled)
- Weaken (remove useful tag/status)

**For Yourself/Allies:**
- Bestow new abilities
- Create items or allies
- Enhance with useful status
- Restore (reduce harmful status, recover scratched tag)

**On Processes:**
- Advance progress status
- Set back with opposite status

### Extra Feats

Catch-all for additional narrative effects (1 Power each, after main action):
- Keep spotlight for follow-up
- Prevent/counter a Threat
- Reach a position
- Block an opponent temporarily
- Grab something accessible
- Add special flair

---

## Statuses

Statuses are special tags with a **tier** (1-6) indicating intensity.

| Tier | Intensity |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | Mild |
| 2-3 | Moderate |
| 4-5 | Severe |
| 6 | Deadly/Transformative |

### Using Statuses

- Add tier of highest helpful status to Power
- Subtract tier of highest hindering status from Power
- Create/reduce by spending 1 Power per tier

### Stacking Statuses

When adding a status that already exists (or is similar):
- Mark the new tier box
- If that box is already marked, mark the next empty box to the right
- The tier is always the highest marked box

### Reducing Statuses

Move all marks left by the reduction amount. Marks below 1 are removed. If all marks gone, status is removed.

### Status Types

**Combat:** wounded, parrying, blinded, poised, shielded

**Social/Emotional:** respected, convinced, heartbroken, hostile, beguiled

**Tactical:** alert, hidden, exposed, surprised, tangled

**Physical Conditions:** fatigued, poisoned, hungry, invigorated, paralyzed

**Progress Trackers:** time-passes, ritual-progress, transforming

### Polar Statuses

Opposite statuses (hot/cold, friendly/hostile, hidden/exposed) cancel each other. Remove tiers from the greater equal to the tier of the lesser.

### Compelling Statuses

Include a directive (enraged, hypnotized, charmed). They:
- Hinder actions against the directive
- At Limit: cannot be resisted
- Exceeding Limit: becomes permanent

---

## Limits

Every Hero and many Challenges have a **Limit** (1-6) for how much of a given status they can take.

**Hero Limit: Always 5** for all statuses.

When a status tier **equals** the Limit: **Overcome** (defeated for that status type)
- Can't take actions related to that status

When a status tier **exceeds** the Limit: **Permanent effect**
- For Heroes: death OR deep transformation (theme replacement)

### Challenge Limits

Challenges have different Limits for different approaches:
- Example: Wild boar - hurt 4, scared 4, bonded 4
- Example: Spirit - purged 5, appeased 3, hurt ∞ (immune)

### Progress Limits

Track impending events (ritual completion, time running out, transformation). When maxed, something happens in the narrative.

---

## Consequences

Consequences are negative story developments. Types include:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Blocked** | Lose chance to act or reach a goal |
| **Complication** | Placed in uncertain/awkward position |
| **Exposure** | Someone notices you or reveals hidden info |
| **Ill Tidings** | Something terrible happens |
| **New Challenge** | Unexpected obstacle appears |
| **Yes, But...** | Success is partial, delayed, or conditioned |
| **Negative Effects** | Give negative tags/statuses, scratch positive ones |

---

## Reactions

When taking Consequences, the Narrator may allow a **reaction roll** to lessen them.

Count Power using only **reactive/passive** tags (armor, instincts, shielded). Tags used in the preceding action cannot be invoked again.

| Roll Total | Result |
|------------|--------|
| 10+ | Spend Power + 1 on any Effect |
| 7-9 | Spend Power only to lessen Consequences |
| 6- | Suffer Consequences as-is |

**Lessening Costs:**
- Prevent story tag added: 2 Power
- Prevent tag loss: 2 Power
- Avoid incoming status: 1 Power per tier
- Avoid losing existing status: 1 Power per tier

On 10+, you may also spend on offensive Effects (counterattack, discover, give status to opponent).

---

## Might

Characters and tasks vary in power level. Three levels:

| Level | Description | Typical |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Origin** | Ordinary | Common people, basic tasks |
| **Adventure** | Exceptional | Heroes with relevant themes, notable challenges |
| **Greatness** | World-shaping | Legendary abilities, realm-wide effects |

### Might Aspects

Might applies to specific domains:
- Prowess/Skill (apprentice vs. master)
- Size (human vs. giant vs. titan)
- Numbers (individual vs. army)
- Social Influence (local vs. realm-wide)
- Magical Power (weak vs. incredible)

### Using Might in Actions

**Imperiled** (task is one level above your Might):
- Lose 3 Power
- Consequences increased by 3 status tiers or 1 tag

**Extremely Imperiled** (two levels above):
- Lose 6 Power
- Consequences increased by 6 tiers or 3 tags

**Favored** (task is one level below):
- Gain 3 Power
- Consequences reduced by 3 tiers or 1 tag

**Extremely Favored** (two levels below):
- Gain 6 Power
- Consequences may be nullified

### Hero Might

Heroes are Mighty in aspects covered by their Adventure/Greatness themes. Origin in all other matters.

---

## Quests

Each theme has a Quest - a goal, belief, or personal journey. Quest types:

| Type | Description | Mark Milestone | Mark Abandon |
|------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Your Wish** | Something you long for | Significant step toward goal | Miss/forego opportunity |
| **Your Truth** | A belief to uphold | Resist temptation; reassert dramatically | Act against it |
| **Your Home** | Something to preserve | Reinforce in significant way | Fail to fulfill duty |
| **Your Question** | Something to discover | Find significant answers | Ignore chance to discover |

---

## The Fellowship

The Heroes share a **Fellowship theme** with:
- Title tag + 2 power tags (single-use, scratched when invoked)
- 1 weakness tag
- Shared Quest

Fellowship power tags can be recovered during camp or through actions.

### Fellowship Relationships

Each Hero has **relationship tags** with other Heroes - single-use story tags renewed during camp/sojourn.

---

## Camping and Sojourns

When the Fellowship rests, play through **two periods**. Each Hero chooses one activity per period:

### Rest (once per camp)
- Expire some statuses and negative story tags
- Recover power tags that would naturally recover

### Reflect (once per camp)
- Mark Improve on any theme or Fellowship theme
- Good time to mark Abandon/Milestone on Quests

### Camp Action (can repeat)
- Bandage/heal
- Converse with allies
- Cook a meal
- Craft/repair items
- Entertain others
- Hunt/forage
- Prepare for journey
- Read/research
- Scout ahead
- Stand watch

**Power for Camp Actions:**
- Count Power as normal
- Roll for action (risk Consequences) OR
- If Power 1+, spend half (rounded up) without rolling

**Sojourn Bonus:** +1 Power (days), +2 Power (weeks), +3 Power (months)

### Third Activity

Optional, at cost of Consequences.

### Fellowship Quality Time

At end of camp/sojourn, each Hero may:
- Recover a Fellowship theme tag, OR
- Create a new relationship tag with another Hero

---

## Drawing More Power

### Burn a Tag for Power
Scratch one helpful power/story tag to gain +3 Power instead of +1. (Once per action)

### Push Your Luck
After rolling 10+, accept Consequences for:
- Quick: Greater Success (exceptional execution)
- Detailed: +1 Power to spend

### Trade Power (Detailed only)
- **Throw caution to wind:** If Power ≤ 2, reduce by 1 for roll; on success, spend original + 1
- **Hedge your risks:** If Power ≥ 2, add 1 to roll; on success, spend original - 1

### Helping Each Other
With Narrator permission, a Hero can contribute one tag (+1 Power) to another Hero's roll. The tag cannot be burned.

### Acting Together
For group actions, each Hero contributes one tag. One may burn a tag. Fellowship tags may also apply.

---

## Making a Sacrifice

For extraordinary moments. Accept severe Consequences to achieve the extraordinary.

**Do not add Power to roll.**

| Sacrifice Level | Consequence if Paid | Possible Success |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Painful** | Scratch all tags in a theme | Something unlikely |
| **Scarring** | Replace a theme | Something extraordinary |
| **Grave** | Take tier-6 status | Something impossible |

| Roll | Result |
|------|--------|
| 10+ (Miracle) | Succeed, sacrifice lessened by one level |
| 7-9 (Fate) | Succeed, pay full sacrifice |
| 6- (In Vain) | Pay sacrifice, fail or things go wrong |

---

## Promise and Fulfillment

**Promise** represents hidden potential. Mark it when:
- Evolving or replacing a theme (1 mark)
- Trading extra theme parts (additional marks)
- Choosing it as an Improvement

At **5 Promise marks**: Moment of Fulfillment. Reset track and choose one:
- Arrive at Journey's End (retirement)
- Be Reforged (rebuild Hero)
- Gain a Quintessence
- Shake the Foundations of Magic
- Speak Words Eternal (enchantment)
- Unearth Lost Truths (discovery)

---

## Key Formulas

### Power Calculation
```
Power = (helpful tags × 1) - (hindering tags × 1)
      + highest helpful status tier
      - highest hindering status tier
      ± Might modifier (±3 or ±6)
```

### Roll Interpretation
```
2d6 + Power → 10+ Success | 7-9 Success+Consequences | 6- Consequences
```

### Effect Costs
```
Tag create/scratch: 2 Power
Status create/reduce: 1 Power per tier
Discover: 1 Power
Extra feat: 1 Power
```

---

### Status Tiers
| Tier | Meaning | At Hero Limit (5) | Exceeds Limit |
|------|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1-4 | Temporary condition | - | - |
| 5 | At Limit | Overcome | - |
| 6 | Exceeds Limit | - | Permanent/Death/Transformation |

### Theme Development Summary
| Tracker | Trigger | 3 Marks Effect |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Improve | Weakness invoked | Gain Improvement |
| Milestone | Quest achievement | Theme Evolves |
| Abandon | Quest ignored/betrayed | Theme Replaced |
