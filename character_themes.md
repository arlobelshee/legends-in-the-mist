# Adventure-Level Themes (Working Canvas)

> Each theme below is **adventure-level**.
> Each includes **4 Power Tags**, **1 Weakness**, a **Way of Magic (mechanical constraint)**, and a **Narrative Constraint**.
> This canvas is meant for iteration, trimming, and remixing.

There are two kinds of themes: external-source (extrinsic) and internal-source (intrinsic). An intrinsic magic is something that is inherent in you, whereas an extrinsic one is a way you draw from or interact with your environment.

Extrinsic magics are more dependent on the environment, but they also give you the ability to externalize consequences. Whenever any magic happens, it has side-effects, and you can attempt to either contain them or redirect them. If you contain, it affects you. If you redirect, it affects the space around you. Intrinsic magics are always contained. Whether you choose to contain or redirect, you may be able to resist consequences. The main difference is who suffers the consequences - you or everyone else.

The way of magic for each path includes how it works if contained and if redirected.

# Magic Systems Reference

Each theme uses one of these underlying systems:

## Building Status

A status accumulates on you or the environment. At a threshold, complications occur.

- **Intrinsic Building:** Status accumulates on you. At threshold, you lose control or transform.
- **Extrinsic Building:** Status accumulates on the environment. At threshold, the environment becomes hazardous or changes state. You may choose to contain (take status on yourself) or redirect (push to environment).

## Pet/Harmony

You have a relationship with an entity (creature, spirit, or intelligent item). Acting in harmony strengthens effects. Acting against its nature builds Dissonance. At threshold, the entity acts independently or against you.

## Debt/Bargain

Each use creates a Debt owed to something (spirits, fate, the universe, personas). Debts can be called in by NPCs, the world, or fate. Clear debt by fulfilling obligations or clever negotiation. At threshold, debts come due simultaneously or creditors become hostile.

## Pool/Spend

A pool accumulates as you use magic. You may spend from the pool to amplify, twist, or shortcut effects. At threshold, the GM spends from your pool instead of you.

## Fragmentation

Using magic creates fragments, copies, or separated parts of yourself. These can act semi-independently. At threshold, fragments act at cross-purposes with you or become targets.

## Commitment

Magic only works when you commit to a position, person, or action. Moving or changing breaks the protection. You cannot protect everything at once.

## Chaos Channeler

*Magic misbehaves around you.*

**System:** Pool/Spend

**Power Tags**

- Reality Glitch
- Wild Surge
- Unlikely Success
- Spell Twist

**Weakness**

- Backfires

**Way of Magic – Instability**\
Each spell adds **Instability**.

- Each chaos channeler power tag you apply increases instability by 1. You can also increase it by 2 to add one more "even more unstable" tag to the effect - repeat as desired.
- Instability is applied quickly to consequences. It does not linger, but affects things *now*.
  - Redirected: spend half now to create weird story tags. Acts as a status on each action by any hero, either helping or hindering depending on whether that action leans into chaos. Each action where it helps, spend half to create a weird effect story tag.
  - Contained: remains as a status on you. Impacts all your actions - even your help for others. Acts as a status that supports or reduces actions depending on their degree of chaos. Each time it interacts, spend half to create a weird story tag.
- At **Instability-5** (for you or the environment), it all releases in a wild surge. Make effects that generally hinder the heroes as story tags.

**Narrative Constraint**\
Magic reacts emotionally to danger, stress, and drama.

**Way of Magic – Cold Build**\
Cryomancy creates **Cold** equal to the number of cryomancy tags used in the effect.

- Cold is about control and rigidity. As cold increases, everything becomes more rigid.
- If the environment hits **Cold-4**, things become brittle and shatter unexpectedly. Everything is silent and there is no backing down.
- If the cryomancer hits their cold limit, then they become unable to alter course or adapt. They cannot change their minds about anyone with less than an hour to re-think. They must identify their action and plan first, then do it no matter what anyone else chooses.

**Way of Magic – Saturation**\
Each elemental use adds **Saturated** equal to the number of Elemental Savant tags you apply.

- The environment gets a status (fiery-x, calcified-x, fluid-x, blustery-x) which matches saturated.
- If the environment his its limit (4), then it gains tags associated with the element, and those effects become a new challenge.
- If you get to your **Saturated** limit, you partially transform into your element, gaining power and complications. You become an elemental.

**Narrative Constraint**\
The environment increasingly behaves like your element.

- This magic cannot be contained. It is external only.
- When the tempo effects an action, the status reduces by 2. However, if that action is a song-weaving effect, then it creates a new status equal to its power and directed as appropriate.

Silence, noise, and interruptions matter deeply.
