# Adventure-Level Themes

> Each theme below is **adventure-level**.
> Each includes **4 Power Tags**, **1 Weakness**, a **Way of Magic**, and a **Narrative Constraint**.
> Balanced for one-shot play with younger players.

There are two kinds of themes: external-source (extrinsic) and internal-source (intrinsic). An intrinsic magic is something that is inherent in you, whereas an extrinsic one is a way you draw from or interact with your environment.

Extrinsic magics are more dependent on the environment, but they also give you the ability to externalize consequences. Whenever any magic happens, it has side-effects, and you can attempt to either contain them or redirect them. If you contain, it affects you. If you redirect, it affects the space around you. Intrinsic magics are always contained.

---

# Magic Systems Reference

Each theme uses one of these underlying systems:

## Building Status

A status accumulates on you or the environment. You get stronger as it builds. At threshold, something dramatic happens.

- **Intrinsic Building:** Status accumulates on you. At threshold, you transform or lose control in a dramatic way.
- **Extrinsic Building:** Status accumulates on the environment. At threshold, the environment changes dramatically. You may choose to contain (take status on yourself) or redirect (push to environment).

**Standard Rule:** Gain 1 status per power tag you use from this theme. Threshold is 4 unless stated otherwise.

## Pet/Harmony

You have a relationship with an entity (creature, spirit, or intelligent item). When you work together, you're stronger. When you fight its nature, it gets frustrated.

**Standard Rule:** Acting in harmony gives +1 Power. Acting against its nature adds 1 Strain. At Strain-4, it acts on its own.

## Immediate Price

When you use magic, you pay a price RIGHT NOW. Something transforms, vanishes, or breaks in a funny way.

**Standard Rule:** Small magic = small price. Big magic = big price. Prices are inconvenient or funny, never permanent.

## Immediate Demands

When you use magic, something demands payment RIGHT NOW. It wants a weird favor done immediately.

**Standard Rule:** Small help = small ask. Big help = big ask. Refusing builds Annoyed status on the helper.

## Binding Words

Your words have power and bind you the moment you speak them. But they also make you incredibly strong when you're keeping your word.

**Standard Rule:** Each promise adds 1 Bound. While keeping a promise, your magic is stronger. At Bound-4, your promises conflict and tangle you up.

## Pool/Spend

A pool accumulates as you use magic. You can spend from the pool to do awesome bonus effects.

**Standard Rule:** Gain 1 pool per power tag used. Spend pool for bonus effects (1 pool = 1 minor twist, 2 pool = 1 major twist). At Pool-5, the GM can spend from your pool instead.

## Fragmentation

Using magic creates copies or separated parts of yourself. These can act semi-independently.

**Standard Rule:** Each fragment is a story tag. At 3+ active fragments, they may act on their own or get targeted.

## Commitment

Magic only works when you commit to a position, person, or action. Your protection is absolute while committed, nothing while broken.

**Standard Rule:** Declare what you protect. While committed, your defense is extraordinary. Moving or changing breaks it completely.

- **Prices Are Funny:** The universe thinks irony is hilarious. You can try to aim the price at something you don't care about, but the universe has preferences.
- Prices fade at the end of the scene. The embarrassment lasts forever.

- **Reflections Can Be Destroyed:** Breaking the surface they inhabit shatters them. Enemies learn to break mirrors.
- **3+ Reflections (Threshold):** Things get confused. You might swap when you didn't mean to, reflections might act on their own, or you might forget which one is the real you.

Shadows are your home. But the more you fade, the less real you become.

**System:** Commitment

**Power Tags**

- Shield Wall
- Hold the Line
- Bodyguard

**Way of Magic – Commitment**
Your defense only works where you **commit**. Half-measures provide nothing.

- **Declare Your Commitment:** At the start of each scene (or when you choose), declare what you are protecting: a person, a doorway, an area, an object.
- **While Committed:** Your defensive abilities are extraordinary. You can stop attacks that would bypass normal defenses. You can hold against impossible odds.
- **Breaking Commitment:** Moving away from your commitment, or trying to protect something else, breaks the protection COMPLETELY. You must declare again.
- **The Hard Choice:** You cannot protect two things at once. Enemies WILL make you choose.

- **Mischief-5 (Threshold):** The GM can spend from your Mischief pool. Magic is now pranking EVERYONE—including you and your friends.
- **Clear Mischief:** Reduce by 2 when you let magic play harmlessly—small illusions, sparkles, harmless pranks that entertain without stakes.

**System:** Binding Words

**Power Tags**

- Blink Step
- Enchanted Weapon
- Impossible Grace
- Duelist's Precision

**Weakness**

- Bound by Promises

**Way of Magic – Binding Words**
Every boast, promise, or accepted challenge binds you IMMEDIATELY.

- **Making Promises:** Say "I'll defeat you" and you literally cannot retreat from that fight. Say "I won't hurt you" and you physically can't attack that person.
- **Keeping Promises:** While you're doing what you promised, your magic is STRONGER. Add +1 Power when keeping your word.
- **Bound Status:** Each active promise adds 1 **Bound**. At Bound-4, your promises conflict and tangle. ("I'll protect you" + "I'll defeat him" = trouble when he grabs you as a shield.)
- **Ending Promises:** Promises end when fulfilled exactly or when the other person releases you from it.

**Narrative Constraint**
Every word matters. The clever duelist promises only what they intended to do anyway.

---

- **Drift:** Each time you separate or act far apart, gain 1 **Drift**.
- **Drift-4 (Threshold):** Body and shadow act at cross purposes. Your shadow might pursue its own goals, hide information from you, or refuse to rejoin.
- **Clear Drift:** Reduce by 2 when you reunite in darkness. Reduce by 1 when you feed your shadow something it wants (scaring someone, learning a secret, swallowing a light source).

**Narrative Constraint**
Bright light forces your shadow back and causes pain. Your shadow has been learning things without you.
