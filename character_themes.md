# Adventure-Level Themes (Working Canvas)

> Each theme below is **adventure-level**.
> Each includes **4 Power Tags**, **1 Weakness**, a **Way of Magic (mechanical constraint)**, and a **Narrative Constraint**.
> This canvas is meant for iteration, trimming, and remixing.

There are two kinds of themes: external-source (extrinsic) and internal-source (intrinsic). An intrinsic magic is something that is inherent in you, whereas an extrinsic one is a way you draw from or interact with your environment.

Extrinsic magics are more dependent on the environment, but they also give you the ability to externalize consequences. Whenever any magic happens, it has side-effects, and you can attempt to either contain them or redirect them. If you contain, it affects you. If you redirect, it affects the space around you. Intrinsic magics are always contained. Whether you choose to contain or redirect, you may be able to resist consequences. The main difference is who suffers the consequences - you or everyone else.

The way of magic for each path includes how it works if contained and if redirected.

---

# Magic Systems Reference

Each theme uses one of these underlying systems:

## Building Status

A status accumulates on you or the environment. At a threshold, complications occur.

- **Intrinsic Building:** Status accumulates on you. At threshold, you lose control or transform.
- **Extrinsic Building:** Status accumulates on the environment. At threshold, the environment becomes hazardous or changes state. You may choose to contain (take status on yourself) or redirect (push to environment).

## Pet/Harmony

You have a relationship with an entity (creature, spirit, or intelligent item). Acting in harmony strengthens effects. Acting against its nature builds Dissonance. At threshold, the entity acts independently or against you.

## Immediate Price

When you use magic, you pay a price RIGHT NOW. Something you have transforms, vanishes, or breaks. The price is never money—it's always something inconvenient or funny. At threshold, the prices become ridiculous.

## Immediate Demands

When you use magic, something demands payment RIGHT NOW. It wants a weird favor done immediately—not later. Refusing builds up annoyed helpers who become distracting.

## Binding Words

Your words have power and bind you the moment you speak them. Promises, boasts, and challenges limit what you can do RIGHT NOW. At threshold, your words tangle you up so much you can barely act.

## Pool/Spend

A pool accumulates as you use magic. You may spend from the pool to amplify, twist, or shortcut effects. At threshold, the GM spends from your pool instead of you.

## Fragmentation

Using magic creates fragments, copies, or separated parts of yourself. These can act semi-independently. At threshold, fragments act at cross-purposes with you or become targets.

## Commitment

Magic only works when you commit to a position, person, or action. Moving or changing breaks the protection. You cannot protect everything at once.

## Ragebound Berserker

*Your fury is supernatural.*

**System:** Building Status (Intrinsic)

**Power Tags**

- Enraged Strength
- Ignore Pain
- Smash Through
- Intimidating Presence

**Weakness**

- Cannot Back Down

**Way of Magic – Rage**\
You gain **Rage** when you are hurt, insulted, or strike powerfully.

- Rage increases physical attack and physical defense.
- Rage penalizes magic, mental, and social actions.
- At **Rage-4**, you must attack, charge, or destroy something on your turn.

**Narrative Constraint**\
Enemies provoke you deliberately. Allies must redirect, calm, or make space for your fury.

---

## Chaos Channeler

*Magic misbehaves around you.*

**System:** Pool/Spend

**Power Tags**

- Reality Glitch
- Wild Surge
- Unlikely Success
- Spell Twist

**Weakness**

- Backfires

**Way of Magic – Instability**\
Each spell adds **Instability**.

- Each chaos channeler power tag you apply increases instability by 1. You can also increase it by 2 to add one more "even more unstable" tag to the effect - repeat as desired.
- Instability is applied quickly to consequences. It does not linger, but affects things *now*.
  - Redirected: spend half now to create weird story tags. Acts as a status on each action by any hero, either helping or hindering depending on whether that action leans into chaos. Each action where it helps, spend half to create a weird effect story tag.
  - Contained: remains as a status on you. Impacts all your actions - even your help for others. Acts as a status that supports or reduces actions depending on their degree of chaos. Each time it interacts, spend half to create a weird story tag.
- At **Instability-5** (for you or the environment), it all releases in a wild surge. Make effects that generally hinder the heroes as story tags.

**Narrative Constraint**\
Magic reacts emotionally to danger, stress, and drama.

---

## Cryomancer

*Cold is control.*

**System:** Building Status (Extrinsic)

**Power Tags**

- Chill Out
- Ice Sculpting
- Numbing Chill
- Frozen Armor

**Weakness**

- Rigid and Brittle

**Way of Magic – Cold Build**\
Cryomancy creates **Cold** equal to the number of cryomancy tags used in the effect.

- Cold is about control and rigidity. As cold increases, everything becomes more rigid.
- If the environment hits **Cold-4**, things become brittle and shatter unexpectedly. Everything is silent and there is no backing down.
- If the cryomancer hits their cold limit, then they become unable to alter course or adapt. They cannot change their minds about anyone with less than an hour to re-think. They must identify their action and plan first, then do it no matter what anyone else chooses.

**Narrative Constraint**\
The battlefield grows silent, slippery, and fragile.

---

## Elemental Savant

*One element, taken too far.*

**System:** Building Status (Extrinsic)

**Power Tags**

- Shape Element
- Elemental Blast
- Elemental Body
- Environmental Control

**Weakness**

- Elemental Mindset

**Way of Magic – Saturation**\
Each elemental use adds **Saturated** equal to the number of Elemental Savant tags you apply.

- The environment gets a status (fiery-x, calcified-x, fluid-x, blustery-x) which matches saturated.
- If the environment his its limit (4), then it gains tags associated with the element, and those effects become a new challenge.
- If you get to your **Saturated** limit, you partially transform into your element, gaining power and complications. You become an elemental.

**Narrative Constraint**\
The environment increasingly behaves like your element.

---

## Name-Binder

*Names define reality.*

**System:** Building Status (Intrinsic)

**Power Tags**

- True Name
- Rename the World
- Words That Cut
- Naming Curse

**Weakness**

- Names Stick

**Way of Magic – Identity Strain**\
Renaming things adds **Identity Strain** as reality pushes back against your changes.

- When you rename something, the new name becomes true. A coward named "Brave" gains courage; a door named "Wall" won't open.
- Each renaming adds Strain. Bigger changes (renaming a person vs. an object, changing fundamental nature vs. surface traits) add more.
- Strain makes your own identity unstable. You may answer to the wrong name, forget your own history, or find your role shifting.
- At **Strain-3**, your own name and role begin to shift. Others may rename you, and it sticks. You may forget who you were.
- Clear Strain when someone who knows the real you says your true name with feeling—or by doing something so "you" that it reminds everyone (including yourself) who you really are.

**Narrative Constraint**\
People remember what they are *called*, not what they were. Be careful what you name yourself.

---

## Songweaver

*Music shapes space and emotion.*

**System:** Building Status (Extrinsic)

**Power Tags**

- Battle Rhythm
- Lullaby
- Crescendo
- Sonic Pulse

**Weakness**

- Needs to Be Heard

**Way of Magic – Tempo**\
Your music establishes **Tempo**.

- Fast tempo fuels action and chaos.
- Slow tempo calms and controls.
- The environment always has a pair of opposing statuses: `fast tempo-x` and `slow tempo-x`. Weaving songs swings the tempo.
- This magic cannot be contained. It is external only.
- When the tempo effects an action, the status reduces by 2. However, if that action is a song-weaving effect, then it creates a new status equal to its power and directed as appropriate.

**Narrative Constraint**\
Silence, noise, and interruptions matter deeply.

---

## Bearer of the Singing Sword

*The sword sings. You don't have to.*

**System:** Pet/Harmony

**Power Tags**

- Dissonant Howl
- Rhythmic Strike
- Echoing Parry
- Resonant Cleave

**Weakness**

- The Sword Has Opinions

**Way of Magic – Harmony**\
The sword has emotions and preferences. Acting in harmony strengthens effects; ignoring it builds **Dissonance**.

- The sword responds to emotional truth, not tactical sense. It loves courage, hates cowardice, and has strong feelings about honor.
- When you act in harmony with the sword's values, your strikes and parries gain power.
- When you act against its nature (retreating when it wants to fight, showing mercy when it wants blood), you gain Dissonance.
- At **Dissonance-3**, the sword acts independently—singing when you need silence, refusing to cut, or striking at targets you didn't choose.
- Clear Dissonance by giving the sword what it wants—one brave act, one honorable choice, one moment of letting it sing.

**Narrative Constraint**\
The blade reacts to emotions, not tactics. It has opinions about everyone you meet.

---

## Beast Controller

*You command a massive, monstrous beast.*

**System:** Pet/Harmony

**Power Tags**

- Monstrous Companion
- Shared Senses
- Coordinated Assault
- Devastating Charge

**Weakness**

- The Beast Is Willful

**Way of Magic – Control Strain**\
Commands that go against the beast's instincts generate **Strain**.

- The beast has its own desires: hunt, protect territory, avoid fire, flee from certain predators. Commands aligned with instinct cost nothing.
- Commands that fight instinct (hold still when threatened, attack something terrifying, ignore prey) add Strain.
- Clear Strain by letting the beast do ONE thing it really wants—chase something, eat something, scare someone, take a nap in the sun.
- At **Strain-3**, the beast follows instinct instead of orders. It may flee, attack the wrong target, or refuse to move.

**Narrative Constraint**\
The beast reacts emotionally to fear, pain, and threats. It remembers who hurt it.

---

## Beast-Hearted

*You are not fully human anymore.*

**System:** Building Status (Intrinsic)

**Power Tags**

- Bestial Strength
- Heightened Senses
- Savage Leap
- Predator's Instinct

**Weakness**

- Easily Provoked

**Way of Magic – Ferality**\
Physical dominance and primal action adds **Ferality**.

- Ferality boosts physical and sensory actions.
- Ferality penalizes social grace, patience, and fine manipulation.
- At **Ferality-4**, instinct overrides plans. You act on impulse.

**Narrative Constraint**\
You struggle with doors, etiquette, and patience. Civilization grates.

---

## Spirit Speaker

*Spirits always want something.*

**System:** Immediate Demands

**Power Tags**

- Call Spirits
- Spirit Sight
- Bargain with the Unseen
- Channel Otherworldly Power

**Weakness**

- Haunted

**Way of Magic – Spirit Demands**\
Spirits help, but they want something RIGHT NOW.

- When you call a spirit, it helps—but immediately demands something in return. Small help = small ask. Big help = big ask.
- Spirit demands are weird: "Tell that person a secret," "Break something pretty," "Say my name three times," "Give me your lunch."
- If you refuse or can't pay, the spirit gets annoyed and adds **Haunting**. Haunted spirits follow you around being distracting and unhelpful.
- At **Haunting-3**, the spirits are SO annoying. They make noise at bad times, hide your stuff, and give bad advice loudly.
- Clear Haunting by finally giving a spirit what it wants, or by finding something even better to offer.

**Narrative Constraint**\
Spirits are always watching. They have opinions about everything.

---

## Doppelganger

*You are many people.*

**System:** Building Status (Intrinsic)

**Power Tags**

- Perfect Mimicry
- Borrowed Faces
- Social Infiltration
- Voice and Mannerisms

**Weakness**

- Identity Drift

**Way of Magic – Confusion**\
Each time you change faces, add **Confusion**.

- Confusion makes your identity slippery. You might accidentally slip into the wrong voice, use the wrong mannerisms, or call someone by a name only another persona would know.
- At **Confusion-2**, you slip between faces without meaning to. The GM can have you accidentally shift at awkward moments.
- At **Confusion-4**, you get stuck. Either you can't change back to your real face, or you forget which face IS your real face.
- Clear Confusion by spending time as your true self, doing something only the real you would do.

**Narrative Constraint**\
NPCs react to who they *think* you are. Try not to forget who that is.

---

## Merchant of Impossible Goods

*Everything has a price.*

**System:** Immediate Price

**Power Tags**

- Produce Anything
- Make a Deal
- Twist the Fine Print
- Unexpected Inventory

**Weakness**

- Owed Favors

**Way of Magic – Immediate Price**\
When you produce something impossible, the universe takes payment NOW.

- Every item you produce costs something immediately. Small item = small price. Big item = big price.
- The price is never money. Something you have vanishes, transforms, or breaks. Your sword turns to flowers. Your map becomes blank. Your shoes swap left and right.
- You can try to aim the price at something you don't care about, but the universe has a sense of humor.
- At **Price-3** (times you've paid), the prices get ridiculous. Your voice becomes squeaky. Your hair changes color. Gravity works sideways for you.
- Prices fade at the end of the scene, but the embarrassment lasts forever. 

**Narrative Constraint**\
The universe always gets paid. It thinks irony is hilarious.

---

## Mirror Adept

*You are never where you seem.*

**System:** Fragmentation

**Power Tags**

- Create Reflections
- Swap Places
- Reflect Attacks
- Mirror Step

**Weakness**

- Fragile Anchors

**Way of Magic – Fragmentation**\
Each trick creates a **Reflection**—a semi-real copy that exists in mirrors, water, or polished surfaces.

- Reflections persist until dismissed or destroyed. Each active reflection adds to your Reflection count.
- You can see through reflections, swap places with them, or have them take actions (though they're limited to what a reflection could do).
- Reflections can be targeted and destroyed. Breaking the surface they inhabit shatters them.
- At **Reflection-3**, misplacements occur. You may swap when you didn't intend to, reflections may act on their own, or you may forget which one is "real."
- Clear by dismissing reflections or consolidating back into your single true self.

**Narrative Constraint**\
Reflections may act independently or be targeted. Enemies learn to shatter mirrors.

---

## Shadowbound

*You are halfway gone.*

**System:** Building Status (Intrinsic)

**Power Tags**

- Melt into Darkness
- Shadow Strike
- Umbral Escape
- Cloak of Gloom

**Weakness**

- Light Burns

**Way of Magic – Fading**\
Shadow use adds **Fading** as you become less real, more shadow.

- Fading makes you harder to see, harder to touch, harder to remember. This can be useful.
- As Fading increases, you slip through cracks, blend into darkness, and become difficult to harm.
- But Fading also makes it harder for allies to help you, for healing to work, for people to notice you exist.
- At **Fading-4**, you are difficult to affect—or assist. Allies' aid barely reaches you. You may be forgotten mid-conversation.
- Clear Fading by stepping into bright light, touching something real and solid, or having someone grab you and yell your name like they mean it.

**Narrative Constraint**\
You risk losing touch with the physical world. Sometimes people look right through you.

---

## Blood of Giants

*Ancient power lives in your body.*

**System:** Building Status (Extrinsic)

**Power Tags**

- Titanic Strength
- Earth-Shaking Blows
- Unstoppable Advance
- Towering Presence

**Weakness**

- Big Target

**Way of Magic – Shockwaves**\
Massive actions create **Shockwaves** that ripple outward through the environment.

- When you hit hard, stomp, or throw your weight around, Shockwaves build in the environment.
- Shockwaves affect everyone and everything nearby—friend and foe, floor and ceiling.
- You can direct Shockwaves somewhat (aim the tremor, focus the impact), but collateral effects are inevitable.
- At **Shockwaves-4**, the environment becomes unstable. Structures crack, floors collapse, things fall. The area becomes dangerous for everyone.
- Clear Shockwaves by letting the environment settle, or by moving to a new area (though you'll start building again).

**Narrative Constraint**\
Subtlety is difficult; everything notices you. Ceilings have load limits.

---

## Iron Defender

*You decide where the line is.*

**System:** Commitment

**Power Tags**

- Shield Wall
- Hold the Line
- Bodyguard
- Brace for Impact

**Weakness**

- Slow to Reposition

**Way of Magic – Commitment**\
Your defense only works where you **commit**. Half-measures provide nothing.

- At the start of each scene or when circumstances change, declare what you are protecting: a person, a doorway, an area, an object.
- While committed, your defensive abilities are extraordinary. Attacks that would bypass normal defenses are stopped. You can hold against impossible odds.
- Moving from your commitment, or trying to protect something else, breaks the protection entirely. You must recommit.
- You cannot protect two things at once. Enemies will exploit this—threatening what you're not protecting, forcing impossible choices.
- There is no "threshold" for this system—the constraint is the commitment itself. The magic is absolute while held, nothing while broken.

**Narrative Constraint**\
You cannot save everyone at once. Enemies will make you choose.

---

## Pyromancer

*Fire always wants more.*

**System:** Building Status (Extrinsic)

**Power Tags**

- Inferno Burst
- Living Flame
- Fire Immunity
- Explosive Spread

**Weakness**

- Everything Burns

**Way of Magic – Escalation**\
Each fire action escalates size or intensity. Fire always wants more.

- Fire builds on itself. Each use adds **Escalation** to the environment as flames spread, heat builds, and things catch.
- You're immune to your own fire, but your allies aren't. Neither are buildings, treasures, or escape routes.
- You can actively reduce scale by smothering flames, creating firebreaks, or pulling heat back into yourself (which has its own costs).
- At **Escalation-4**, the fire becomes a wildfire—an environmental hazard that acts on its own, spreading, consuming, and cutting off options.
- Clear Escalation by putting out fires (mundane or magical), moving to unburned areas, or waiting for fuel to run out.

**Narrative Constraint**\
Fire reshapes the battlefield permanently. What you burn stays burned.

---

## Trick-Spark

*Magic loves a prank.*

**System:** Pool/Spend

**Power Tags**

- Illusions
- Sudden Bursts
- Misdirection
- Spell Pranks

**Weakness**

- Unreliable

**Way of Magic – Misfire Pool**\
Each spell adds **Misfire** to your pool. The magic builds up, wanting to play.

- Misfire accumulates whether your spells succeed or fail. Magic just wants to happen.
- You may spend Misfire to twist outcomes in your favor: turn a near-miss into a hit, add an unexpected effect, have something "coincidentally" go your way.
- The twists are never quite what you expected. They work, but with a punchline. The guard slips on a banana peel. The lock opens but the door falls off.
- At **Misfire-4**, the GM spends your pool instead of you. The twists still happen, but now magic is pranking everyone—including you.
- Clear Misfire by letting magic play harmlessly: small illusions, sparks, harmless pranks that entertain without stakes.

**Narrative Constraint**\
Magic responds with humor, irony, and chaos. It thinks everything is funny.

---

## Fey-Touched Duelist

*Too fast, too clever, too bound.*

**System:** Binding Words

**Power Tags**

- Blink Step
- Enchanted Weapon
- Impossible Grace
- Duelist's Precision

**Weakness**

- Bound by Promises

**Way of Magic – Binding Words**\
Every boast, promise, or accepted challenge binds you IMMEDIATELY.

- Say "I'll defeat you" and you literally cannot retreat from that fight. Say "I won't hurt you" and you physically can't attack that person.
- Your magic is strongest when doing what you promised. It fails completely if you try to break your word.
- Each binding adds **Bound**. At **Bound-2**, your promises start conflicting. ("I'll protect you" + "I'll defeat him" = problems when he grabs you as a shield.)
- At **Bound-4**, you're so tangled in promises you can barely move without breaking one.
- Promises end when fulfilled exactly ("I'll defeat you" ends when they're defeated) or when the other person releases you from it.

**Narrative Constraint**\
Every word matters. The clever duelist promises only what they intended to do anyway.

---

## Living Shadow

*You are a creature of darkness.*

**System:** Fragmentation

**Power Tags**

- Detach from Body
- Shadow Tendrils
- Darkvision Everywhere
- Slip Through Cracks

**Weakness**

- Tethered to Darkness

**Way of Magic – Separation**\
You can separate your shadow from your body, operating as two entities.

- When separated, your shadow can scout, manipulate objects, or attack from darkness while your body acts elsewhere.
- Each separation adds **Drift**. The longer and further apart you operate, the more Drift accumulates.
- Bright light forces your shadow back to your body and may cause pain or disorientation.
- At **Drift-3**, body and shadow act at cross purposes. Your shadow may pursue its own goals, hide information from you, or refuse to rejoin.
- Clear Drift by reuniting in darkness and doing something together—or by feeding your shadow something it wants (scaring someone, learning a secret, swallowing a light source).

**Narrative Constraint**\
Light disrupts your cohesion and control. Your shadow has been learning things without you.
