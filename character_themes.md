# Adventure-Level Themes

> Each theme below is **adventure-level**.
> Each includes **4 Power Tags**, **1 Weakness**, a **Way of Magic**, and a **Narrative Constraint**.
> Balanced for one-shot play with younger players.

There are two kinds of themes: external-source (extrinsic) and internal-source (intrinsic). An intrinsic magic is something that is inherent in you, whereas an extrinsic one is a way you draw from or interact with your environment.

Extrinsic magics are more dependent on the environment, but they also give you the ability to externalize consequences. Whenever any magic happens, it has side-effects, and you can attempt to either contain them or redirect them. If you contain, it affects you. If you redirect, it affects the space around you. Intrinsic magics are always contained.

---

# Magic Systems Reference

Each theme uses one of these underlying systems:

## Building Status

A status accumulates on you or the environment. At threshold, something dramatic happens.

- **Intrinsic Building:** Status accumulates on you. At threshold (4), you gain dramatic power with constraints. At your limit (5), you transform—incredibly powerful but no longer fully yourself.
- **Extrinsic Building:** Status accumulates on the environment as story tags. At threshold (4), the environment transforms and becomes its own challenge.

**Standard Rule:** Gain 1 status per power tag you use from this theme.

## Opposing Status

Two poles exist in tension. Using one builds that status; the opposite cancels it out. Both poles have uses—the question is which dominates the scene.

**Standard Rule:** Statuses on the same axis cancel. Remove tiers from the greater equal to the tier of the lesser.

## Pet/Harmony

You have a relationship with an entity (creature, spirit, or intelligent item). When you work together, you're stronger. When you fight its nature, it gets frustrated.

**Standard Rule:** Acting in harmony gives +1 Power. Acting against its nature adds 1 Strain. At Strain-4, it acts on its own.

## Immediate Price

When you use magic, you pay a price RIGHT NOW. Something transforms, vanishes, or breaks in a funny way.

**Standard Rule:** Small magic = small price. Big magic = big price. Prices are inconvenient or funny, never permanent.

## Immediate Demands

When you use magic, something demands payment RIGHT NOW. It wants a weird favor done immediately.

**Standard Rule:** Small help = small ask. Big help = big ask. Refusing builds Annoyed status on the helper.

## Binding Words

Your words have power and bind you the moment you speak them. But they also make you incredibly strong when you're keeping your word.

**Standard Rule:** Each promise adds 1 Bound. While keeping a promise, your magic is stronger. At Bound-4, your promises conflict and tangle you up.

## Fragmentation

Using magic creates copies or separated parts of yourself. These can act semi-independently.

**Standard Rule:** Each fragment is a story tag. At 3+ active fragments, they may act on their own or get targeted.

## Commitment

Magic only works when you commit to a position, person, or action. Your protection is absolute while committed, nothing while broken.

**Standard Rule:** Declare what you protect. While committed, your defense is extraordinary. Moving or changing breaks it completely.

## Ragebound Berserker

*Your fury is supernatural.*

**System:** Building Status (Intrinsic)

**Power Tags**

- Enraged Strength

- **Rage-4 (Threshold):** You MUST attack the biggest threat you can see. Your attacks are devastating but you can't hold back or be subtle.

- **Clear Rage:** Reduce by 1 when combat ends and you catch your breath, or when someone you trust calms you.

**Weakness**

- Backfires

**Way of Magic – Chaos**
Each time you use a Chaos Channeler power tag, add 1 **Chaos** to the environment.

- **Chaos-4 (Threshold):** Reality gets weird. The GM gains story tags representing the strangeness: *gravity suggestions*, *doors go elsewhere*, *time hiccups*. These affect everyone.
- **Order opposes Chaos:** Deliberate, predictable actions (following a plan exactly, doing things by the book) add Order to the environment. Order and Chaos cancel each other.
- **Clear Chaos:** Chaos naturally reduces by 1 each scene, or when someone imposes structure and routine.

**Narrative Constraint**
The weirder things get, the more you thrive—but your allies might not.

---

**Weakness**

- Elemental Mindset

**Way of Magic – Saturation**
Each time you use an Elemental Savant power tag, add 1 **Saturation** to the environment (or contain it on yourself).

- **Saturation status:** The environment gains story tags matching your element. Saturation helps actions using your element; hinders actions opposing it.
- **Saturation-4 (Threshold):**
  - *Environment:* Your element dominates. The GM gains major story tags: *living stone walls*, *howling wind tunnels*, *churning water fills the room*. It becomes its own challenge.
  - *You (if contained):* You partially transform into your element. Add +2 Power to elemental actions, but you think like your element.
- **Saturation-5 (Your Limit):** Full elemental transformation. Incredibly powerful, but you ARE your element now.
- **Clear Saturation:** Reduce by 1 when the opposite element appears or after a scene without using your element.

## Name-Binder

*Names define reality.*

**System:** Building Status (Intrinsic)

**Power Tags**

- True Name
- Rename the World
- Words That Cut

**Way of Magic – Identity Strain**
You gain 1 **Strain** when you rename something. Bigger changes (a person's nature vs. an object's appearance) may add 2.

- **Strain-1 to 3:** Your renamings work perfectly. Strain adds to actions where names and identity matter.
- **Strain-4 (Threshold):** Your own name becomes unstable. Others can rename YOU, and it works. You might answer to the wrong name or forget details about yourself.
- **Strain-5 (Limit):** You become what others name you. Your identity is completely fluid—powerful, but you are whoever the last person said you were.
- **Clear Strain:** Reduce by 1 when someone calls you by your true name and means it, or when you do something unmistakably YOU.

**Narrative Constraint**
People remember what they are *called*, not what they were. Names have power over everyone—including you.

**System:** Opposing Status (Fast Tempo/Slow Tempo)

**Power Tags**

- Battle Rhythm
- Lullaby
- Crescendo
- Sonic Pulse

**Weakness**

- **Slow Tempo:** Helps calm actions, defense, and careful work. Hinders quick or aggressive actions.
- **Tempo-4 (Threshold):** The Tempo dominates the scene. At Fast-4, everyone acts in a frenzy—story tags like *everything accelerates*, *no time to think*. At Slow-4, time crawls—*movements drag*, *thoughts stretch*.
- **Fast and Slow oppose:** They cancel each other out. You (or others) can shift the tempo by playing the opposite.
- **Clear Tempo:** Tempo naturally reduces by 1 each round. Complete silence clears all Tempo.

**Narrative Constraint**
Silence, noise, and interruptions matter deeply. Your music affects everyone—friend and foe.

- **Dissonance:** When you act against its nature (retreating, deception, cruelty), gain 1 **Dissonance**.
- **Dissonance-4 (Threshold):** The sword acts on its own. It might sing when you need silence, refuse to cut someone it respects, or strike at targets you didn't choose.
- **Clear Dissonance:** Reduce by 1 when you let the sword do what it wants—one brave charge, one honorable choice, one moment of glory.

**Narrative Constraint**
The blade reacts to emotions. It will let everyone know what it thinks of them.

- **Strain-4 (Threshold):** The beast follows its instincts instead of your orders. It may flee, attack the wrong target, or refuse to move.
- **Clear Strain:** Reduce by 1 when you let the beast do ONE thing it really wants—chase, eat, scare someone, or take a nap.

**Narrative Constraint**
The beast remembers who hurt it and who fed it. It has feelings about everyone.

- **Ferality-1 to 3:** Ferality adds to physical actions, senses, and intimidation. Ferality hinders patience, etiquette, and fine manipulation.
- **Ferality-4 (Threshold):** You act on instinct. Incredibly powerful—but you think like an animal. Chase what runs, fight what challenges you, protect your pack.
- **Ferality-5 (Limit):** Full beast. You ARE the animal now. Immense power, but human concerns and plans are gone.
- **Clear Ferality:** Reduce by 1 when you do something civilized (share food politely, have a calm conversation, wait patiently).

- **Big Help (2+ power tags):** Big ask—"Give away something you value," "Do something embarrassing," "Let me borrow your voice for a minute."
- **Refuse Payment:** If you can't or won't pay, the spirit gets **Annoyed-1**. At Annoyed-4, spirits around you are SO distracting—making noise, hiding your stuff, giving bad advice loudly.
- **Clear Annoyed:** Reduce by 2 when you finally give a spirit what it wants.

**Narrative Constraint**
Spirits are always watching. They have opinions about everything and everyone.

---

- **Clear Confusion:** Reduce by 1 when you spend time as your true self, doing something only the real you would do.

**System:** Immediate Price

**Power Tags**

- Make a Deal
- Twist the Fine Print
- Unexpected Inventory

**Weakness**

- Owed Favors

- **Big Item (2+ power tags):** Big price—your sword turns to flowers, your map goes blank, your shoes swap left and right, gravity works funny for you.
- **Prices Are Funny:** The universe thinks irony is hilarious. You can try to aim the price at something you don't care about, but the universe has preferences.
- Prices fade at the end of the scene. The embarrassment lasts forever.

**Narrative Constraint**
The universe always gets paid. It prefers comedy.

**System:** Fragmentation

**Power Tags**

- Create Reflections
- Swap Places
- Reflect Attacks
- Mirror Step

**Weakness**

- Fragile Anchors

**Way of Magic – Reflections**
Your tricks create **Reflections**—semi-real copies that exist in mirrors, water, or polished surfaces.

- **Active Reflections:** Each reflection is a story tag. You can see through them, swap places with them, or have them take simple actions.
- **Reflections Can Be Destroyed:** Breaking the surface they inhabit shatters them. Enemies learn to break mirrors.
- **3+ Reflections (Threshold):** Things get confused. You might swap when you didn't mean to, reflections might act on their own, or you might forget which one is the real you.
- **Clear:** Dismiss reflections to reduce your count. Consolidate back into one true self.

**Narrative Constraint**
More reflections means more options—but also more targets and more confusion.

---

- **Fading status:** Helps stealth, escape, and slipping through. Hinders being noticed, getting help, and affecting the physical world.

- **Fading-5 (Limit):** You become shadow. Immensely powerful in darkness, but sunlight is agony and you may not be able to return.
- **Presence opposes Fading:** Bright light, physical contact, or someone calling your name with feeling adds Presence. Presence and Fading cancel each other.
- **Clear Fading:** Reduce by 1 when you step into bright light or when someone grabs you and says your name like they mean it.

**Narrative Constraint**
Shadows are your home. But the more you fade, the less real you become. Your allies can anchor you.

---

**System:** Commitment

**Power Tags**

- Shield Wall
- Hold the Line
- Bodyguard
- Brace for Impact

**Weakness**

- Slow to Reposition

**Way of Magic – Commitment**
Your defense only works where you **commit**. Half-measures provide nothing.

- **Declare Your Commitment:** At the start of each scene (or when you choose), declare what you are protecting: a person, a doorway, an area, an object.
- **While Committed:** Your defensive abilities are extraordinary. You can stop attacks that would bypass normal defenses. You can hold against impossible odds.
- **Breaking Commitment:** Moving away from your commitment, or trying to protect something else, breaks the protection COMPLETELY. You must declare again.
- **The Hard Choice:** You cannot protect two things at once. Enemies WILL make you choose.

**Narrative Constraint**
You cannot save everyone at once. But what you commit to, nothing can touch.

---

Each time you use a Trick-Spark power tag, add 1 **Mischief** to the environment.

- **Mischief status:** The environment gains story tags representing pranks and coincidences: *slippery floors*, *things in wrong places*, *convenient distractions*. Mischief helps creative improvisation and trickery. Mischief hinders serious, careful, or dignified actions—for everyone.
- **Mischief-4 (Threshold):** Magic is pranking EVERYONE. The GM gains major story tags: *nothing is where it should be*, *gravity is a suggestion*, *cause and effect are negotiable*. The pranks aren't malicious, but they're relentless.
- **Clear Mischief:** Reduce by 1 when you let magic play harmlessly—small illusions, sparkles, harmless pranks with no stakes.

**System:** Binding Words

**Power Tags**

- Blink Step
- Enchanted Weapon
- Impossible Grace
- Duelist's Precision

**Weakness**

- Bound by Promises

**Way of Magic – Binding Words**
Every boast, promise, or accepted challenge binds you IMMEDIATELY.

- **Making Promises:** Say "I'll defeat you" and you literally cannot retreat from that fight. Say "I won't hurt you" and you physically can't attack that person.
- **Keeping Promises:** While you're doing what you promised, your magic is STRONGER. Add +1 Power when keeping your word.
- **Bound Status:** Each active promise adds 1 **Bound**. At Bound-4, your promises conflict and tangle. ("I'll protect you" + "I'll defeat him" = trouble when he grabs you as a shield.)
- **Ending Promises:** Promises end when fulfilled exactly or when the other person releases you from it.

**Narrative Constraint**
Every word matters. The clever duelist promises only what they intended to do anyway.

---

## Living Shadow

*You are a creature of darkness.*

**System:** Fragmentation

**Power Tags**

- Detach from Body
- Shadow Tendrils
- Darkvision Everywhere

**Weakness**

- Tethered to Darkness

**Way of Magic – Separation**
You can separate your shadow from your body, operating as two entities.

- **While Separated:** Your shadow can scout, manipulate objects, or attack from darkness while your body acts elsewhere. Each counts as a story tag.
- **Drift:** Each time you separate or act far apart, gain 1 **Drift**.
- **Drift-4 (Threshold):** Body and shadow act at cross purposes. Your shadow might pursue its own goals, hide information from you, or refuse to rejoin.
- **Clear Drift:** Reduce by 2 when you reunite in darkness. Reduce by 1 when you feed your shadow something it wants (scaring someone, learning a secret, swallowing a light source).

**Narrative Constraint**
Bright light forces your shadow back and causes pain. Your shadow has been learning things without you.
