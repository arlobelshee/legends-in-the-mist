                                    VOL. I � THE HERO

 Long ago, in kingdoms long
                   forgotten, great sovereigns
                   uncovered the secrets of
                   Thaumaturgy and labored to
       bring wonders and joy to their people.

       That Great Age ended with betrayal, greed,
       and unbridled wrath. Wretched power was
       unleashed, and perils hitherto unknown to
       mankind came into the world: Creatures of
       twilight and of malice, cunning, and terror.

       Ancient towers and forts fell and
       sank in the swamps of time, and with
       them, the secrets and answers that
       could ward off the darkness.

                                           Centuries passed by.
                                           The world grew cold. Folk got
                                           by, their hearts growing ever
                                           more suspicious under the threat
                                           of the shadows in the night.

       But now, something is awakening -
       a seed of hope that was sequestered
       in the faraway mountain villages,
       hidden until the day it will be called
       upon to make whole that which was
       broken, and restore hope to all.

       A call stirs deep within the
       hill-folk to venture forth and unveil
       a truth long forgotten. Little do
       they know the journeys ahead,
       and the perils that await...

                                              Let's tell a Legend in the Mist!
                                              In this game you play a character, the Hero,
                                              and tell a story about their journey.
                                              The story has a Narrator, which can be you or
                                              another player, and there can be other Heroes, too.
                                              For now, the Narrator will be this book.

           The Hero

              In this tutorial story, you are Gerrin, the deer
              stalker. Your character is made out of tags,
              the short descriptors above highlighted in yellow.
              To play, you will need two six-sided or Legend
              in the Mist dice, and some pen and paper or
              Tracking Cards and markers to track changes.

                                                                                                                                      11

On this fateful day,
Gerrin is out hunting.

    Your Themes & Tags

     Your Hero's four main tags have other tags attached to them, providing
     more details. Together, each such set of tags is called a theme. The tags in a
     theme are called power tags, except for the last tag in each theme, which is
     a weakness tag, highlighted in orange.

                         The Story

                              The story begins with some exposition from the Narrator which poses a
                              quest, something at stake that propels the Hero to undertake a journey.

                              While the player (you) plays the Hero, the Narrator plays all non-Hero or
                              non-player characters (NPCs). These can be the Hero's allies, mentors,
                              enemies, rivals, or passersby - anyone who might feature in the Hero's story.

                                                                                                                                      13

         misty threshold between the prosaic world of the mundane and
         the hidden world of legends.

         With the secrets you'll glean from these pages, you will soon
         weave a tale of your own. You will take your unlikely hero
         on journeys into foreign lands, to face challenges mighty and
         strange, to make great sacrifices and at long last prevail against
         the world's perils � or falter and become lost to oblivion.

         May this game, one of many in the sacred tradition of
         storytelling and roleplaying, be a source of rich enjoyment for
         you and your fellow travelers and a path to the wisdom and
         courage hidden within you.

54  --  LEGEND IN THE MIST - VOL. I - THE HERO

THIS IS A
ROLE-PLAYING GAME

Legend in the Mist is a role-playing game. Like the fireside storytellers
of old, you play it by gathering around the table, in person or online,

and having a dynamic conversation where you tell a fantasy story, a

legend.

In your story, players take on the role of the Heroes, choosing and
describing their thoughts, feelings, actions, and sacrifices, while the
Narrator sets the scenes, describes people, places, and fantastical

beings along the journey, and enforces the timeless rule that every
action taken by the Heroes has consequences.

This game also has built-in tools for playing in solo or co-op modes,

where a single player playing alone or a group playing together share
both the role of the Heroes and the role of the Narrator.

You use the game rules to propel your story forward, control the

pacing and the difficulty level of the challenges faced by the Heroes, and
to offer surprising outcomes to your Heroes' actions.

In every game session, from scene to scene, you play out another
chapter of the Heroes' story, experiencing new dramatic, emotional,
and exciting moments to your heart's content!

WHAT YOU'LL
NEED TO PLAY

THIS BOOK
This book explains the rules of the game and provides ample materials
and guidance for players and Narrators for creating compelling Heroes
and exciting adventures.

A GROUP
If you're playing in a group, 2-6 players (including the Narrator) is ideal.
Find players to play with among your friends, family, or other social
circles, online (such as on the Son of Oak Discord server), in community
centers (such as clubs or libraries), or in gaming conventions.

                                                                              I ntroduction  --  55

        A PLACE TO PLAY
        You can have your game sessions in person or online, such as on a video call, on
        Discord, on a virtual tabletop platform, or play-by-post on chat channels and forums.

        SAFETY TOOLS
        Role-playing games are a pastime and a hobby, so make sure everyone feels
        comfortable at the table. We recommend maintaining an atmosphere of respect and
        open discussion, and suggest using safety tools such as Lines & Veils, available online,
        to sync on what content is okay or not okay for your group to have in your game.

        TOOLS & ACCESSORIES

        At the very least, you'll need a way to record your notes (pencils and papers or a
        digital medium) and a way to roll two six-sided dice (physically or digitally). Each
        Hero needs a copy of the character sheet (Hero, Theme, and Fellowship cards) found

        at the end of this book.

        At your option, you can use these Legend In The Mist accessories:

        Theme Cards for recording your                                     Tracking Cards for recording story tags and

                     Heroes' details                                            statuses with dry or wet erase markers

        Acorn Dice (six-sided) or River Pebble Dice                        The Narrator's Screen with a summary

        (twelve-sided dice that repeat the numbers 1 to 6                         of the rules for quick reference
                 twice, so they act as six-sided dice)

PRINCIPLES OF
GOOD ROLEPLAYING

PLAY FOR THE STORY
This game isn't competitive. While the Heroes may want to win
the day, players and Narrator play together to spin and enjoy an
entertaining yarn. Revel in the discovery and drama of every new
development, whether a dreaded consequence or a wonderful success.

BE THE CHARACTERS' GREATEST FAN
You both create and follow the unfolding story of your Heroes, so let
yourself get excited about their qualities, abilities, potential, failures,
and growth. Portray them, their allies, and their adversaries as dynamic
characters using your imagination and flair.

PLAY FAIR AND COLLABORATE
Listen to one another and be respectful of each others' boundaries.
Share the spotlight, lift up your fellow Heroes, and make choices that
would promote a better game for everyone at the table. Work with the
Narrator and accept their rulings and the results of the dice.

MAKE THIS GAME YOUR OWN
Nothing in this game is set in stone � use it in the way that's most fun
for you and your group.

                                                                             I ntroduction  --  57

        COMING FROM
        OTHER RPGS

        Legend In The Mist stands out in the landscape of tabletop role-
        playing games as a wholly tag-based (description-based) game. If
        you're coming to Legend In The Mist after having played stat- and
        class-based tabletop RPGs, you're in for a liberating treat: you'll no
        longer be limited in the type of characters you can create, the actions
        you can take, or the stories you can tell.

        Such freedom is so great that it can be jarring, so we packed this book
        with tools like tropes and theme kits (page 80) to help you quickly
        make the most of it. If you come from especially rules-heavy games,
        check out also the Action Grimoire (available where you got this book)
        as a reference guide on how to express the wide range of actions
        possible in Legend In The Mist.

        Here are a few things to remember when you move to Legend In The Mist:

        THIS IS A NARRATIVE GAME

        Like in a fantasy novel, the focus is on dramatic actions, tough choices, and gripping
        story developments, while blurring unimportant details. For example, you don't track
        exactly how much coin your character has or what exactly they're carrying; instead,
        you track only the items that matter for the story.

        IT'S BUILT TO SUPPORT                                              INITIATIVE IS DRAMATIC,

58  --  LEGEND IN THE MIST - VOL. I - THE HERO

        THERE ARE NO STATS,                                                I ntroduction  --  59
        ONLY TAGS

           Your Hero, the challenges they face, and the world around
           them are described solely using short descriptors called

         tags: instead of "17 Strength", you have rippling muscles

           and lifting strength. This colors every ability and action
           with unique narrative flavor and allows you to create any
           imaginable character or power set you can dream up.

           THERE IS ONLY ONE KIND
           OF DICE ROLL IN THIS GAME �
           ONE ROLL TO RULE THEM ALL
           � AND IT'S POWERED BY TAGS.

              It's a 2d6 roll modified by the number of helpful tags
              you have for this action (and some other factors). Each
              action or reaction roll is characterized differently by
              the situation, by the tags you use to power it, and by
              the effects you choose as its outcome.

           THE OUTCOME (EFFECT OR
           "DAMAGE") OF YOUR ACTIONS AND
           YOUR ADVERSARIES' ACTIONS IS
           ALSO EXPRESSED WITH TAGS.

              You can give an enemy a wound tag, give an ally a buff
              tag, remove a negative tag from yourself, or summon or
              craft a new tag. Some outcomes are purely narrative and
              do not use tags at all.

           THE NARRATOR AND PLAYERS DECIDE
           WHICH TAGS ARE RELEVANT OR
           IRRELEVANT FOR ANY GIVEN ACTION.

              This is best done with a collaborative, clear-cut mindset
              at the table, where the Narrator promptly rules out
              tags that don't directly affect the action and players
              find creative uses for tags without stretching their
              application too far. There are ample tools to support
              you with this, such as rules for indirectly relevant
              tags (which cost an extra action) and optional rules for
              capping tag numbers, as well as the Action Grimoire.

           ALL DICE ROLLS ARE MADE
           BY THE PLAYERS

              The Narrator never rolls the dice, leaving them free
              to direct the drama. When adversaries cause harm
              in a conflict, it's the Heroes who roll for a reaction.
              Challenges have their own tags that affect Hero rolls.

START HERE

CHOOSE YOUR FRAME OF PLAY

You begin by deciding on your Frame of Play: the setting and nature

of the story you'll tell.

Ask yourself, in what kind of world is your story set? Who are the
Heroes? What brings them together? What types of challenges and
dangers do they face?

Consider the story's themes and highlights. Will you tell of love, war,
redemption? Is magic common, risky, divine?

Legend in the Mist is primarily a game of rustic fantasy, a subgenre of

fantasy explained in the next pages, but it can be used to tell any fantasy
tale. The following pages provide suggestions of four frames of play to
build your game around, rustic or otherwise.

THE PROLOGUE:
CREATE YOUR HEROES & FELLOWSHIP
Your Frame of Play will inform your choices as you set up your game,

starting with Hero & Fellowship Creation on page 72.

Once your Heroes are ready, the Narrator can find additional

guidelines for Setting Up A Game and creating adventures starting on

Volume II, page 8.

        RUSTIC FANTASY

        While you can use this game to play any fantasy story, Legend in the Mist
        is first and foremost a game of "rustic fantasy" � but what does that mean?

                                     IT'S ABOUT THE SIMPLE, LITTLE THINGS.
                                   Rustic fantasy is intimate and detailed � it tells stories in which the
                                   Heroes are moved and impressed upon by the everyday sensations
                                   around them: the smell of herbs brewing in a cauldron in the hearth;
                                   the soft snow falling on a lichen-covered stone path; a fisherman's deft,
                                   wrinkly hands as they knot twine; or yellowing grass blades swaying in
                                   the gentle wind. There is a kind of special presence in the little things, a
                                   momentary elation of spirit.

                                   This appreciation of detail extends to all practical aspects of life and
                                   all manner of crafts depicted in the story: handwritten recipes of
                                   decoctions, strange and specific magical laws, local folklore about
                                   creatures and their weaknesses, a carefully packed lunch for the road, or
                                   simply day-to-day sayings � these all come together to create the cozy
                                   or gritty texture of the tale.

                                     IT'S ABOUT SMALL HEROES FROM
                                     OUT-OF-THE-WAY PLACES WHO DISCOVER
                                     THEIR GREAT DESTINIES � OR NOT.
                                   Often beginning in a remote rural setting, rustic tales tell the stories
                                   of those who would be "nobodies in particular" from "nowhere
                                   of importance", but something calls them toward a greater world.
                                   Whether they are victims of circumstances or have a seed planted in
                                   them by the most mysterious of forces, and whether they remain true
                                   to their humble origins to the end of the tale or meet that great world
                                   with greatness of their own, well, that remains to be seen.

                                     IT'S ABOUT SMALL HEROES FACED WITH
                                     GREAT PERILS, OFTEN BEYOND THEIR
                                     POWER OR UNDERSTANDING.
                                   Forces of the great world outside � war and politics, greedy sorcerers,
                                   and strange monsters � penetrate the Heroes' enclosed existence and
                                   demand that they rise up to meet them. And forces of yet another,
                                   invisible world, scarcely-knowable and hidden in every little thing, steer
                                   the Heroes' lives or observe intently from the shadows, perhaps because

                              the fate of much greater things hangs in the balance. All of these evoke
                              a great sense of mystery in the face of the unknown.

62  --  LEGEND IN THE MIST - VOL. I - THE HERO

IT IS ABOUT JOURNEYS THROUGH
THE COUNTRYSIDE AND WILDERNESS,
AND LIVING CLOSE TO NATURE.

Rural living entails traveling through pastoral or wild landscapes on a
regular basis because almost anything you need is far away, and every
venture into the woods is a step into a realm of mystery. Beyond, the great
world beckons with its tractless expanses, dense forests, and dramatic
mountains. The trail, the lay of the land, the weather, and the perils along
the way are all key � as are the lessons learned and the breathtaking vistas
that unfold before the Heroes. What you pack matters, not so much as a
list of provisions but as a reflection on who you are.

ULTIMATELY, RUSTIC FANTASY IS ABOUT EVOKING
THAT TENDER FEELING OF THE LEGENDARY.

Nostalgic yet current, made-up yet true, a good legend manages to
reach past the practicality and cynicism of daily life and into a place long
forgotten within us, to nourish it with wisdom drawn from the universal
experiences of us all, through the Heroes of the tale. It reminds us to
pause and look at the Heroes' journey from the perspective of the invisible
watchers, knowing in our hearts that even though peril is imminent and
the fate of the Heroes hangs in the balance � there is still hope. And that
whether they rise or fall, in the end, it was a story worth telling.

                                                                              I ntroduction  --  63

        OUR LITTLE CORNER
        OF THE WORLD

        Your story could be centered entirely around the minute happenings
        of a small village, community, or region, with the world at large as a
        mere background. The stakes are always low, at least to the eyes of an
        outsider, but for the Heroes, the runaway sheep of the neighbor or the
        absentmindedness curse placed by the old grump on the village smith pose
        serious concerns. Plots begin rather small and seemingly inconsequential,
        but in time they can spiral into the creepy, dangerous, or heroic.

        � Absence of might: The Heroes are by and large simple people

           without much power.

        � No magic, or everyday practical magic: Powerful magic, if it

           exists, is rare and beyond the scope of this story.

        � Wholesome rewards: Emotional rewards, such as gaining self-

           esteem or the thanks of a neighbor or relative; handy everyday items;
           or a remarkable local discovery.

        � Detail-oriented: What kind of cheese is it? Is the sword rusty, well-

           worn, or visibly crafted by an amateur?

        � Lighthearted: Rejoice in the mundane and enjoy this hour.

        � Local cast: Tavern clientele, village elders and leaders, neighbors

           near and far.

        � Short-range travel: Journeys to an outlying farm or a friend who

           lives in the woods.

        THE HEROES MIGHT BE...

        Tavern Buddies, a whimsical version where the Heroes are a bunch

        of good-for-nothings thrown into local adventures for no reason other
        than being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

        Protectors Against the Dark, a grimmer version where the Heroes must

        protect the pastoral lifestyle of their community from the encroaching
        perils of the outside world, such as raids, monsters, or a creeping blight.

AN EPIC JOURNEY

Your story could be centered around a journey undertaken as part of a
greater quest or purpose. Perhaps there is imminent danger to the world
or region, such as a dark tyrant or impending doom, or the fellowship is
tasked with finding a rare cure or undoing a curse. Along the way, they
must traverse many lands, contend with enemies most monstrous, have
dealings with monarchs and strange beings, and uncover the secrets that
will lead them to complete their quest. They may be called to find great ar-
tifacts of old or mysterious magical powers that are the key to their quest.

� A mixed bag of power levels: Strong and capable Heroes, and

   even those with a major role to play in the coming world-drama,
   travel alongside wide-eyed villagers, who nevertheless are essential
   to the cause.

� A mixed bag of commitment: Every Hero may have their own

   reason to be on the journey.

� Long journeys: Through war-ravaged lands, obscure parts of the

   world that hold important artifacts, or to faraway strongholds in
   search of allies.

� Supplies matter: Travel is demanding and prolonged, and at times

   takes the Heroes to barren lands. What one carries or can forage or
   hunt is important.

� Grand and lofty magic: Magic is a slowly-revealed mystery, a

   journey in and of itself, and not easily accessed by many. Few if any
   Heroes possess it, and often the chief adversaries hold much greater
   magical power.

� Alternating cast: Every new place holds new meetings with few

   NPCs sticking around throughout the journey.

� High adventure: What new dangers and opportunities await

   beyond the next hill?

THE HEROES MIGHT BE...

A Sworn Fellowship, the classic epic, where the Heroes set out

on a declared quest to save their home or world, fated to face the
consummate evil.

A Traveling Band, a less epic version where the Heroes travel far and

wide together for their own reasons, such as protection on the road.
Or, they are performing a "mundane" task, such as mapping the West
Marches or performing in every tavern in the land.

                                                                              I ntroduction  --  65

        GRIT & POLITICS

        Your story could feature a sense of gritty realism, focusing on a soci-
        ety driven by self-interest, a mean world that takes no prisoners, run
        by cutthroat politics, where a Hero's actions have brutally realistic
        consequences. The Heroes travel a region rife with political, racial, and
        factional tensions, experiencing and at times taking part in its hardships
        and injustices, as they pursue their greater goals.

        � Persons of considerable ability: The Heroes are neither

           great rulers nor pitiful and powerless subjects � they are trained
           individuals able to survive this harsh world, for which they are
           sought after by both king and beggar.

        � Affiliation is key: The Heroes are aligned with one party or

           another, whether they like it or not. Neutrality often demands the
           highest price.

        � Journeying through a social landscape: The political situations

           the Heroes traverse are key. The forest wilds may be dangerous, but
           uncomplicated in comparison.

        � Magic will cost ya: Yet another component of a politically-

           complicated world, magic comes with strings attached or an oft-too-
           high price.

        � Unforgiving consequences: Heroes may die for no good reason,

           especially those with good intentions; non-Heroes certainly will.

        THE HEROES MIGHT BE...

        Itinerant Sellswords, the grittiest version, where the Heroes

        unscrupulously offer a service to any who would pay, wading through
        gutters and visiting halls of power, to fight human monsters and
        monsters who show humanity.

        A Powerful House, a more political version, where the Heroes are

        a part of a ruling elite or their retinue, and play the game of thrones.
        Often based around one house and their stronghold.

66  --  LEGEND IN THE MIST - VOL. I - THE HERO

DUNGEON CRAWL

Your story could focus simply on the joys of adventuring, trea-
sure-seeking, and getting into fun trouble, where the Heroes are
often glory-seeking oddballs and outsiders, drawn together into a
found family or for practical reasons � to survive their next dun-
geon delve. Journeys are more often into the dark of an under-
ground tomb or a long-lost temple, where the Heroes face monsters
and traps. Think of this more as a ramble than a story with a major
plot arc, although it can have one.

� Skilled adventurers: The Heroes know their trade and are

   rarely untrained civilians or world-shaping powers.

� Challenging crawls: Journeys are ventures into complexes that

   are made to challenge the adventurers with traps, monsters, and
   riddles. The journeys between delves are not as interesting.

� Strange people and funny moments: Half of the fun of a

   dungeon adventure is arguing with a magical stone face, taking
   sides in a conflict between animated kitchen utensils, or getting
   your arm turned into jelly.

� Utilitarian magic: Magic is rarely mysterious � it's just one of the

   tools you need in your belt when you descend into the darkness,
   and in your hands it often produces reliable prescribed results.

� Loot is important: Special weapons, armor, and gear are

   needed to face greater dangers and get better loot. Quirky
   magical items abound.

THE HEROES MIGHT BE...

Fortune Hunters, the hardcore crawling option, where the Heroes

care more about reaching the treasure at the end of the dungeon
than anything outside it.

Found Family of Rascals, a more narrative spin, where the

Heroes are a collection of unusual types, oddballs, and weirdos, each
with their own overly-dramatic story arc, who survive in a scornful
world thanks to their talent at reaching treasure.

                                                                           I ntroduction  --  67

        Hero & Fellowship Creation

         Before you begin your game, you need to gather a
                                few details about each of the Heroes in the story
                                and about their group, the Fellowship. Many game
                                groups dedicate the entire first game session to this
                    purpose, and call it Session Zero; here, we call it the Prologue.

                       Begin your Prologue by agreeing on the kind of story you'd like to tell (see some
                       suggestions in the Introduction, page 54). Then, create your Heroes, starting
                       on the next page, and finally create your Fellowship together (page 139).

    THEME TAGS 1
    A THEME is built around a tag that describes a major aspect of                            TRAIT
    your hero such as their temperament, backstory, or abilities, such as
    always attentive, goat herder of Milkrest, or gifted archer.            Strong as an Ox

    Each theme has additional tags, representing its title tag's minor,             lift a heavy load
    related, or secondary aspects. Tags are explained on page 76.                    clobber a bully

    THEME TYPE 2                                                                        tongue tied
    Each of a Hero's themes has a type, which gives general guidance to
    its nature and how it develops. There are 20 theme types, divided into         Use my strength
    the three Might categories, which are explained later:                          to help others.

       Origin themes describe your background and beginnings, who                 SKILL OR TRADE
        you are as an individual. They are Circumstance, Devotion, Past,
        People, Personality, Skill or Trade, and Trait.                      Village Healer

        Adventure themes describe what makes you a hero that stands                 strange remedies
        out from the crowd, someone unique with the power to explore and             quick diagnosis
        impact a greater, more dangerous world. They are Duty, Influence,
        Knowledge, Prodigious Ability, Relic, and Uncanny Being.                       open wounds

        Greatness themes describe what makes you a power unto                    Discover the fabled
        yourself, capable of shaping the course of history. They are               medicines of old.

    Three theme types could fit any of these categories, depending on
    what they describe: Companion, Magic, and Possessions.                      Sword of
                                                                                Thunder
    Your Hero can have any mix of themes of different types and from
    all three categories. Your choice of themes tell us what kind of Hero              shockwave
    they are and their place in the world.                                            call lightning

In some aspects of their life, your Hero is Mighty (page 171). When
using themes with Might, your Hero is able to take grander actions and
expect greater results � but they will also find themself preoccupied
with bigger concerns and shouldering greater responsibilities.

Your Hero's choice of themes also reflects their general place within
the imaginary world of your story, which can change as they evolve or
replace themes.

If you have mostly Origin themes, you are a humble, rather
unimportant individual who is often cast against stronger forces in a
dangerous world. Your might is often in your heart, on a personal level,
or in what is close to the ground, intimate, or underhanded.

If you have mostly Adventure themes, you are a heroic or notable
individual, able to contend with at least some of the many perils of
the world. Your might is often in overcoming danger or adversity,
and your troubles are of a greater order: monsters, villains, and
considerable challenges.

If you have mostly Greatness themes, you are a force that can shape
realms and the destinies of many. Your might is in exercising your power
over the world, and your troubles are equally as grand, because your
might attracts other powerful forces of the world to clash with you.

In a typical rustic fantasy game (page 62), all Heroes begin play
with most or all of their themes being Origin. Discuss your option with
the Narrator, to make sure your choices fit the Frame of Play (page
64) and Fellowship theme.

IMPROVING THE THEME 4

During the game, your themes can grow. When you invoke a weakness
tag, or Reflect during a camp scene (page 179), mark Improve. When
the theme's third Improve is marked, it gains an improvement, which
usually means you can add a new tag to it (page 187).

THE QUEST 5

Each theme includes a quest, a goal, belief, or personal journey of your
Hero that is related to this theme. Following or abandoning a theme's
Quest (Quests & Transformations, page 188) can lead to a significant
change: the replacement of the theme. Whenever you achieve a
significant victory or success in your theme's Quest, mark Milestone;
after the third one, the theme evolves into a new one, developing
further. Whenever you ignore the theme's Quest or act against it, mark
Abandon; after the third one, an aspect of you is lost, making room for
a new one to develop.

After a theme is replaced, you gain Promise (page 193), representing
how your Hero grows overall. Once you've marked Promise five times,
you gain access to unique options that can truly transform your Hero.

    Tags are short descriptors (usually 1-3 words) that define                  QUA LI T I E S & TRA I TS
    important details in the story.
                                                                                       strong as an ox
    They can describe almost anything including abilities, background,                       wise
    items, beings, resources, mental faculties, relationships, style, and                    alert
    more, as well as weaknesses, limitations, and flaws.
                                                                                        flexible joints
    Tags have a dual role: they define what's true in the story, and they             natural climber
    add or reduce the Power from your Hero's actions. When something
    is described as a tag, it's therefore important.                                   BA C K G R O U N D

    A tag's relevance and usefulness is always determined in the                      noble upbringing
    context of what you're doing now. A tag can be useful for one action            seasoned merchant
    and not useful for another, e.g., keen hearing can be useful for hunting
    but not for running, and it can be hindering when trying to ignore a                   farmer
    screeching, discordant sound.                                                      grizzled scout

    All tags are always worth 1 Power. A dagger and a greatsword are
    both worth 1 Power, but each can or cannot be used beneficially in        ITEMS & POSSESSIONS
    different actions and different situations.

    POWER TAGS are permanent tags of your Hero that describe                          elven-made bow
    something that's mostly useful. They cannot be used against you                   bag full of coins

    WEAKNESS TAGS are permanent tags of your Hero that describe                    ALLIES & BEINGS
    something limiting. They cannot be used in your favor (the Narrator
    can rule differently, on rare occasions). However, whenever a                        loyal horse

HERO CREATION

You can create any hero you can
dream of, by describing them with tags.

The Simplest Way:                                                          EhCmHaCewsHistsnnvhthanhvhheoheeooeoevdwistorarfrorusewthooyttyypeloasi,dea.hnooitsHtwsnTRsbagnobpthsehgeveereeeoetehregacmacmhtsooTiitotdhunsgefeesmheinmhhenisotssmoaeilniohebtqimnfsgrmeosaueemghsy,risreasogotyetboikshettuh'spfsutidarhtrsleatlcatebf,amiscHmhhtoinotattheaceoue,,spon.iauiortltorlsdssasnoroyi.tgtmtnoeeaougre,nr,t
Just Write It Down

� Think of their four themes and write them as power tags.
� Add two more power tags and one weakness tag to each

  theme.
� Write a Quest for each theme, and choose a theme type.
� Create one backpack tag.

The Quickest Way:
Pick A Trope

A trope is like a recipe for a Hero. The tropes begin on page 82.
� Pick a trope, and write down its three listed themes.
� Choose a fourth theme from the list.
� Each theme points you at a theme kit, a premade list of tags, from

  which you choose the theme's additional tags (two power tags and
  one weakness) and record your Quest.
� Choose one backpack tag.

The Detailed Way:
Answer Themebook Questions

A themebook is a questionnaire that walks you through the creation
of a theme, and helps you think of the concept behind each choice.
The themebooks begin on page 92.
� Choose four theme types (you can repeat a type).
� Answer the questions in each theme's themebook, to create tags. You

  must answer the first question (in bold) in each themebook, and
  then two more of your choice (you can repeat a question), to create
  power tags. Also answer one weakness tag question of your choice.
� Use the suggestions in the themebook and on the next page to
  come up with a Quest.
� Peruse the General Store (page 132) to pick out one backpack tag.

You can also mix and match these methods, such as by choosing a
trope but answer themebook questions instead of using theme kits, or
creating some themes from themebooks and some from theme kits.

    While you're creating your Hero,
    remember the following:                                                    � Torrabitesftoratytoruirbuptreimary

    � Your power tags should be useful.                                        � Cyoirucrubmasctkagnrcoeunfodr

        Ask yourself: "What kind of actions would this tag support?"

    � Your weakness tags should be limiting.

        Ask yourself: "What kind of actions would this tag hinder?" or
        "How or when would it cause problems for my Hero?"

    � Your tags, especially the title of each theme,
       should match the Might of their theme.

        Greatness theme tags should be grandiose like queen of the realm
        or spell of annihilation; Adventure theme tags should describe
        something above the ordinary, such as remarkable swordfighter or
        blessing of the gods; while Origin theme tags should be ordinary
        like humble gravedigger or local gossip.

    � Your Quests should be clear.

        Most Quests fall into one or more of these categories:

        � Your Wish: Something you long for or aspire to
        � Your Truth: A statement you believe in and want to uphold
        � Your Home: Something you endeavor regularly to preserve
        � Your Question: Something you yearn to know above all

        Ask yourself: "What could be a Milestone for this Quest?" and
        "What kind of actions would be considered Abandoning this Quest?"
        Further advice appears under Types of Quests (page 188).

    � You and the Narrator must have an
       understanding about your tags and Quests.

        Agree in advance on what each means, what they represent and
        when and how they can be used. Talk about which tags are
        directly helpful to an action and which are only relevant in an
        indirect or roundabout way. This will be important during play.

    � Note which tags are broad and which are specific.

        Tags like clever or wizard or rich are broad, meaning they can
        be used in a wide variety of situations and actions. Because of
        this, they usually require an extra action to use (see Indirect
        Tags and Prep Actions, page 153). Specific tags like whirlwind
        slash or sleeping spell can be used directly, but only in appropriate
        situations, so they are more focused and reliable. Try to have a
        balance of broad, specific, and somewhere-in-between tags.

        The Narrator may limit the number of broad tags you have. They
        may also deem some tags, such as lucky, as too broad to have in
        the game, or alternatively as inherently indirect, so that they
        always require an extra action to use.

And you sing, to all who would hark, about
where you've been and all you've seen, be it jolly
good or bitter stark.

Marked since birth with runes of flame, you call                           MAGICIANS
forth fire with every hiss of your tongue or flick
of your fingers. Wild as you are, all you've ever
known is the order of conjurers who raised you,
although there is a growing suspicion in your
mind that some dark truth has been kept from
you. And that just makes you want to set the
world on fire.

so-called "magic". You have travelled far and wide                         more chores. By now you ought to have mastered
and gathered much of this secret knowledge, and                            sorcery altogether, at least by your account, but
yet what you know is as but a drop in the ocean.                           all you can manage are a few tricks and cantrips.
There is so much yet to see and learn...                                   Surely there's a shortcut you could take...

          Circumstance

          BACKGROUND + SOCIAL STANDING +
          UNIQUE SITUATION + WALK OF LIFE

          With this theme, the circumstance in which you currently find yourself
          plays a major role in your story. This could entail your social standing
          or role, whether you are descended from nobility or born to poverty,
          whether you are struggling to survive, hunted for who you are, being the
          village fool nobody takes seriously, and so on. This theme type focuses
          on where you are in life, your unique situation, whether it is inherent or
          temporary.
          � What is your place in life and in society?
          � What's interesting about where you have found yourself?
          � What social position do you possess and how long have you had it?
          � What makes you a stereotypical example of your circumstance? What

            makes you stand apart?
          � Are you a victim of circumstance or did you choose your lot in life?

        Power Tag Questions

        A What Circumstance do you find yourself in?
        B What tools or trappings of your position or station do you carry?
        C Who can you call upon or relate to thanks to your Circumstance?
        D What social skills have you developed as part of your Circumstance?
        E How can you exploit your Circumstance to get out of trouble?
        F Where do you go to be with others of similar social status?
        G What special right or privilege comes with your Circumstance?
        H What knowledge or knack is common to people in your position?
         I How have you learned to overcome your Circumstances?
         J What is the motto or creed you've adopted?

        Weakness Tag Questions

        A What's the biggest challenge you face due to your unique position?
        B What aspect of your Circumstance do others scorn, shun, or detest?
        C What kinds of places or situations are off limits to you?
        D How do others commonly mistreat you?

        Quest Ideas

        � A desire to prove your worth despite your status.
        � An ambition to become the most successful or archetypal member of

          your role.
        � A binding norm or code you adhere to due to your position.

Special Improvements

   Comfort Zone: When you camp or sojourn in the environment of your Circumstance, you may recover
   one scratched power tag in addition to any other benefits.
   Expected Role: Choose a status that represents how society expects you to behave, such as friendly,
   threatening, or in-charge. Once per session, before you take a social action befitting your expected role,
   you may gain this status at tier 2.
   Familiar Matters: There are things everyone in your situation knows. Once per scene, you may ask the
   Narrator for one important detail about a subject related to your Circumstance.
   Strength From Adversity: Once per session, when a weakness tag from this theme is invoked, you may
   gain driven-2, which helps this roll and expires after it.
   Trudging Along: Choose a type of status that you've become accustomed to given your Circumstance, such
   as tired or humiliated. Once per scene, you may ignore a status you have of that type if it is tier 3 or lower.

          Devotion

          IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIPS +
          COMMITMENT TO A GROUP OR IDEAL

          You have dedicated yourself to a person (a loved one, mentor, or
          dependent), a group (your circle of weavers or the village of Woodend),
          or an ideal (religion, creed, or way of life). Your devotion gives you
          meaning, drives you to carry on in difficult times, offers you something
          to go back to when the adventures are over, and serves as a framework
          for knowing right from wrong.
         � What is the most important thing to you, personally?
         � How did you end up caring so much about this person, group, or ideal?
         � Do you chafe under the needs, demands, or ethos of who or what you
           are devoted to?
         � How far would you go to protect that which you are devoted to?

        Power Tag Questions

        A Who or what are you Devoted to?

        F What does the object of your Devotion often help you with?
        G What quality do you possess that best exemplifies your dedication?
        H What approach do you take in social situations due to your Devotion?
         I What ethos or saying do you aspire to live up to in your dedication?
         J What useful ritual or habit do you have to show your Devotion?

        Weakness Tag Questions

        A What are you blind to because of your Devotion?
        B What duties do you have that frequently need your time or resources?
        C What unsightly or destructive behavior can your Devotion evoke in you?
        D What often threatens the object of your Devotion?

        Quest Ideas

        � A simple statement of your Devotion and what you feel towards them or it.
        � Something you hope to gain by your Devotion, the one thing you cling

          to that makes all this sacrifice worthwhile.
        � A task you must complete for your Devotion, such as a ritual, a

          pilgrimage, or an act of heroism.

94  --  LEGEND IN THE MIST - VOL. I - THE HERO

Special Improvements

   Bodyguard: When your Devotion or a person representing it takes Consequence, you may take it
   instead of them (and possibly react to it), if the Narrator deems it possible.
   Catch Me When I Fall: Once per session, when you act with the object of your Devotion or a person
   representing it at your side, and the outcome is only Consequences, you may choose to Succeed as well.
   Deeply Committed: Your dedication fills you with purpose. Once per scene, when you take action to
   pursue this theme's Quest, you may first gain committed-2, which expires after that action.
   Goes Both Ways: Once per session, if the object of your Devotion is near, you may gain a story tag
   representing aid granted by them, such as an item, encouragement, knowledge, or direct help.
   Unwavering: Once per session, when a tag in this theme would be scratched for any reason, you may
   keep it unscratched instead.

           Before you lies a difficult task, a path rife with tribulations, or the
           heavy burden of responsibility, and you must steel yourself if you are to
           accomplish what you set out to achieve. Luckily, such an undertaking
           often means you have the backing of an organization, a person of
           interest, a faction, or even a deity who may believe in your cause or
           stand to gain from your success.

           Influence

           KEY POSITION + AUTHORITY OVER OTHERS +
           CONTACTS & AGENTS + PERSONAL POWER

           You are an individual of considerable import, whether publicly or
           behind the scenes, and as such you command a degree of power and
           influence. This could be owing to your impressive presence or winning
           character, but it just as well could be a result of years of scheming,
           making the right connections, or influencing others in unsavory or
           even unnatural ways.
           � What is the nature of the influence you possess?
           � Do others follow you willingly or begrudgingly?
           � What did you have to undertake or sacrifice to get to this position?
           � How far are you willing to go to keep your power?

         Power Tag Questions

         A What gives you power and Influence over others?
         B What is the most common task or service people do for you?
         C Who are your followers, servants, foot soldiers, or agents?
         D What is the most potent way in which you exert Influence?
         E In what domain is your Influence the strongest?
         F What assets or benefits have you gained thanks to your Influence?
         G Who is the most susceptible to your Influence?
         H How do you grow the reach of your Influence?
          I How do you dismantle others' resistance?
          J How do you protect yourself from others' influence?

         Weakness Tag Questions

         A Who resists, ignores, or is immune to your Influence?
         B What do you do that undermines your own power?
         C Who does your Influence cause you to clash with?
         D What lies outside of your sphere of Influence?

         Quest Ideas

         � The reason or motivation for which you've accumulated all this
           Influence.

         � The attitude or worldview that allowed you to gain power or maintain
           it.

         � A standard of power you measure yourself by.
         � A decree or quest you've been given by a higher authority.

   and Succeed, you may create multiple single-use story tags (page 165) for 1 Power each.

   they could conceivably be, and then take action as that character using tags from this theme.

   may increase the tier of that status by 1 and gain 2 more Power to spend on Effects.

   Read Between the Lines: Whenever you roll a reaction using tags from this theme to lessen a social or
   influence-related Consequence, you receive one valuable detail about the source of the Consequence.

           MYSTICAL INSIGHT

           You possess knowledge that is beyond what is known and
           commonplace and which grants you a deeper understanding of the
           world. You may be innately attuned to deeper understanding, the last
           in a line of keepers who pass on their sacred songs, or an inquisitive
           or scholarly mind who has amassed a body of knowledge through
           experience or studies. Perhaps it was passed down to you in a dusty
           tome or perhaps you see it written in the stars above.
           � What is it that you know that most people do not?
           � How did you come across this knowledge?
           � How did discovering this knowledge change you and your perception

             of the world?

          Prodigious Ability

           RARE GIFT + REMARKABLE PROFICIENCY OR
           CAPABILITY + ASTOUNDING FEATS

           With enough practice and raw talent, the line between natural ability
           and learned methods blurs until only excellence remains. You are a
           most skillful and capable exemplar of your art or ability, showing
           a rare measure of proficiency and style. Feats that seem impossible
           to beginners are routine exercises for you, and you are equipped to
           overcome the hardest challenges of your profession or pursuit. Your
           ability is a source of admiration and envy, and you are widely considered
           to be one of the best in the region, whether because you publicly shame
           the competition or thanks to circulating legends of your deeds.
           � What responsibility do you feel as to how to use your abilities?
           � When faced with a problem that seemingly cannot be solved with

             your ability, how do you act?
           � Are you proud of your hard-earned skills, or angry that you were

             forced to learn what you wish you didn't have to?
           � Are you dismissive of people beneath your level of expertise?

         Power Tag Questions

         A What do you call someone who has your Prodigious Ability?
         B What is a secondary skill or characteristic of this ability?
         C What incredible technique or stunt can you pull off?
         D How can you use your ability to impress and amaze?
         E What emotion unleashes your potential?
         F What is the chief tool you use when practicing your ability?
         G How do you prevent failure or regain the advantage with your ability?
         H What signature move or unique slant did you add to your repertoire?
          I What do you know, sense, or discern that a beginner wouldn't?
          J What nearly (or truly) miraculous thing can you accomplish?

         Weakness Tag Questions

         A What is a flaw or weakness of your ability you are still refining?
         B What bad habits or behaviors have you developed due to your ability?
         C Under what conditions is your ability less effective, even with your

            proficiency?
         D Who resents or harasses you because of your ability?

         Quest Ideas

         � What you must do to stay the best.
         � Your perspective about the responsibility or burdens that come with

           your level of talent.
         � A lofty goal you have undertaken, due to your standing as a skillful

          Relic

           ITEM OF MAGICAL OR SPIRITUAL POWER +
           STRANGE HEIRLOOM + ADVANCED ARTIFACT

           You possess an item of power or a mysterious artifact, which
           changed your life. Its enchanted nature cannot be denied �
           at least not by you � and its power guides or influences your
           decisions and actions. It might be a source of arcane power, a
           container for a spirit, or a relic of a bygone age. Whether you
           deserve, need, or are capable of controlling this power might not
           be important. You already have it. What you'll do and where it'll
           take you are the real questions.
           � What does your relic look like? What kind of item is it?
           � Was your relic a gift, an heirloom, a chance discovery?
           � How obvious is its magic and how far-reaching are its effects?
           � Does it have a will of its own? Is it opinionated? Is it cursed?

         Power Tag Questions

         A What powerful or mysterious item do you possess?
         B What is its most potent power or ability?
         C What is another aspect or part of its magic?
         D What do you feel when you hold, wear, or use it?
         E When does your Relic come to life or becomes stronger?
         F What skill is required to best handle the Relic?
         G Who or what was your Relic made to affect the most?
         H What is revealed to you through the use of your Relic?
          I What is a secret feature of the Relic that no one else knows about?
          J What does your Relic unlock or unleash?

         Weakness Tag Questions

         A What is the most troublesome shortcoming of your Relic?
         B What can interfere with the powers of your Relic?
         C What can damage or destroy your Relic?
         D What has changed in you for the worse because of your Relic?

         Quest Ideas

         � A task you must accomplish related to your Relic, such as to keep it
           working.

         � A vision or destiny the item pushes you towards or even requires
           you to fulfill.

         � A responsibility that comes with this item's power, or a behavior it
           enables.

           nature. Perhaps you are a spirit manifested from the otherworld

           dark sorcery, or a lingering soul of the deceased.

your Destiny (despaired, tired, cursed, etc.), you may avoid these Consequences completely.

Special Improvements

Always Prepared: Once per scene, when a broad tag from this theme is indirectly relevant to your
action, you may use it as directly relevant instead, skipping the required prep action.

Calculated Sacrifice: Before Making a Sacrifice at the Grave sacrifice level related to your Mastery,
replace a theme other than this one that is dearest to you. You may then treat a 7-9 roll as a 10 or more
result. If you Succeed, you don't need to replace another theme � you already paid that price.

Foresee the Outcome: Once per session, you may declare that an action in which you rolled a total of 9
or less (including Power) was only a prediction of an unwanted outcome and did not actually happen.
Disregard the action and take a different action instead.

Lifelong Insight: When you replace this theme, you may keep one of the Special Improvements you
chose (except for this one) and add it to the new theme.

Second Wind: Once per session, you may restore two scratched tags in this theme, at the cost of
scratching one tag on another theme.

         THE GENERAL STORE

         Every Hero begins with one tag in their backpack and may
         acquire additional tags during the game, whether by taking
         actions to obtain or purchase items, or by receiving tags from
         the Narrator based on the developments in the story, such as
         when finding a buried chest full of treasure.

         The tags in your backpack are story tags (page 164) and expire after a
         while when it makes sense in the story, such as when your item needs
         maintenance or replenishment. You then must recreate the tag to retain
         its advantage. Remember, your backpack tags represent what items are
         important for the story, so not every item you carry needs a tag.

         This section offers some suggestions of tags you can pick out for your first
         tag or obtain during the game.

         Armor

         Armor tags improve your reaction roll when you lessen the Consequences
         of attacks. Decide with your group whether you use different types of
         armor tags for flavor only, where every tag equally adds to your Power,
         or in a more realistic and tactical manner, where the armor's description
         determines when the tag applies and when it does not.

132  --  LEGEND IN THE MIST - VOL. I - THE HERO

LIGHT ARMOR
� Buff coat, gambeson, or arming doublet, a thickly padded leather coat.

  Worn on its own, often by hunters or foot soldiers, it offers flexibility
  and protects the wearer from slashes and glancing arrows, but not
  from direct thrusts or clear shots. Worn under heavier armor, it
  improves overall protection and prevents chafing.

� Leather armor or boiled leather armor, is a flexible and versatile armor
  that can somewhat reduce the harm from blades and arrows but does
  little to stop a direct hit. Easier to make but clumsier and smellier is the
  unprocessed hide armor.

� Jack of plates or brigandine, is a leather armor reinforced with metal
  inserts. Often worn over a padded armor (see above), it offers greater
  protection.

HEAVY ARMOR
Heavy armor tags can apply to a greater range of defensive reactions,
but also hinder actions that require range of motion or lightness, such as
swimming. These armors are costly, and some require rare expertise or
advanced facilities to make. Often, they also require personal fitting by
the armorsmith.
� Cuirass, two pieces of armor of various materials covering the chest and

  back, or breastplate, the front part, often paired with other armor pieces
  like greaves or pauldrons.

� Chainmail, made of hundreds of tiny metal links, or the long shirt
  of chainmail called hauberk which sometimes includes a hood,
  provides protection against all but the most powerful attacks, such as
  crossbow bolts and charging lance thrusts. It is also inefficient against
  bludgeoning weapons.

� Plate armor, heavy and solid metal armor, further padded and
  reinforced with cloth, leather, and chainmail.

� Mail & plate, a combination of chainmail and plate armor that provides
  heavy protection with some flexibility.

� Helm, a helmet made of leather or metal protecting the head. The more
  it covers, the more it constricts hearing and sight.

SHIELDS
� Buckler, a small shield used to deflect melee strikes, but which offers

  little protection against projectiles (unless wielded by someone
  uncannily fast!).

� Simple wooden shield, simple to make and offers protection from the front.

� Heavy shield, a bulky metal or metal-banded wood shield, some even as
  tall as a soldier.

Consider also which important colors, badges, emblems, or motifs adorn
your armor or shield. Your kingdom's sacred symbol, family heraldry, or
patron animal may be emblazoned upon it, allowing you to be identified on
the battlefield, and show who and what you stand for.

                                                                           I - H ero & F ellowship Creation  --  133

         Assistance

         Hired help, enthusiastic followers, distant family members, or fellow
         travelers on the same boat can all prove useful by giving advice,
         providing expertise, or simply being another set of hands. Some require
         regular payment, while others might move on or eventually lose interest
         in you or your cause.

         � Attendant, issued by the local leader to take care of you during your stay.
         � Boat handler, paid to take you down the river and avoid the dangers.
         � Fairy servant, conjured for a day and a night.
         � Informant, delivering stolen secrets; spreading misinformation will cost

           more.
         � Local guide, will show you around for a coin and a tale.
         � Mule, stubborn but brave, with a strong back to carry supplies or the

           injured.
         � Storyteller, a bard and performer, committing your tale to history.
         � Torchbearer, because someone needs to hold the torch (or lantern) and

           walk ahead.

         Clothing & Accessories

         Clothes play a role in social interactions and may denote one's status
         and place in life. High or low, you are judged by how you dress, and
         what you wear can open doors or shut them. Different regions develop
         different styles, and markings such as pins, choice of feathers, or sewn
         decorations can tell much about your hometown and profession.

         � Bracers, wrist protection common among archers.
         � Cape, dramatically showing your status or flamboyance.
         � Court dress, fine clothing worn at court.
         � Gloves, offering warmth and protection for your hands when working.
         � Jewelry, lavishly exhibiting your wealth.
         � Jerkin or tunic, simple or luxurious long shirts.
         � Oilskins, clothing made waterproof by treating it with oil, wax, and gum.
         � Sturdy boots, ready for the outdoors.
         � Surcoat, a long heavy coat, perhaps showing your house colors.
         � Travel cloak, keeping you warm when riding.
         � Vestments, traditional garb of religious or political figures.

Notes

Your backpack holds any story tag you hold onto, and these can include
stories you know, memories you cherish, or tricks you prepared. Like most
thoughts, they eventually fade.

� Directions to (choose), learned from a map or given by a local.
� Funny anecdote, to get in someone's graces or defuse a situation.

         Spiritual & Magical Trinkets

         In places where magic or superstition is common, people make small
         items invested with their beliefs or with a bit of supernatural power. The
         actual utility of such a trinket depends on the kinds of magic that exist in
         your setting.

         � Fortune telling tools, carved bones, rune-covered stones, tea leaves,
           painted cards, etc.

         � Good luck charm, a hard-to-find plant or intricately crafted tchotchke.
         � Prayer beads, a physical means of easily counting prayers.
         � Religious icon, a display of faith.
         � Scrying mirror, an expensive means of unlocking clairvoyant powers.
         � Spirit-warding symbol, a seal of protection.
         � Talisman of spiritual power, a small depiction of an important spirit.
         � Wand, a short stick for controlling spells.

         Supplies & Travel Gear

         Every journey presents its own perils, and it can be difficult to know
         what to pack. It also greatly depends on whether you're on foot or on
         horseback, with a cart or a caravan, or on a boat. Starting out, think
         about how much you'd be willing to carry on your back and what might
         keep you from being agile in an ambush, or during a storm. What might
         you eschew, knowing that you could do some foraging on the road?

         � Bedroll, warm and soft, at least softer than the ground.
         � Carving knife, personal utensil for stabbing and slicing meat and bread.
         � Cloth tent, complete with rope, hammer, and pitons.
         � Frying pan, for preparing food or as defensive weapons in a pinch.
         � Repair kit, a needle, thread, spare buckles, and small tools for fixing gear.
         � Signal whistle, for secret codes or just alerting companions.
         � Soap & cloth, for washing up.
         � Spyglass, for scoping out threats.
         � Travel provisions, such as food, water, and mount feed.

Weaponry

The world is dangerous, whether you're facing beasts in the wild,
robbers in an alley, or the armies of the dead. And yet, many young
adventurers can only afford to arm themselves with the tools of their
trade and perhaps a family weapon at their side. Think about what
you might be able to scrounge up in your home and your community
when setting out.

As with Armors (see page 132), decide with your group how
detailed you'd like to go when applying weapon tags.
� Axe, be it a woodcutter's axe or a double edged battle axe.
� Bludgeoning weapons such as clubs, cudgels, hammers, and maces.
� Bow, carefully crafted ranged weapons, such as hunting bows,

  longbows, and recurve bows.
� Dirk, a long knife or dagger, good for stabbing and throwing alike.
� Flail, a handle attached to a chain-linked striking end, to fling over

  shields.
� Polearm, long-handled weapons with a blade or point, such as

  spears, halberds, and pikes.
� Slingshot, easily made tool for launching rocks, fruits, and other

  annoyances.
� Staff, such as a quarterstaff, shepherd's crook, or perhaps a wizard's staff.
� Sword, stick them with the pointy end: shortsword, longsword,

  arming sword, curved sword, scimitar, saber, and many other types.
� Two-handed, great weapons such as greatswords, flamberge swords,

  great axes, and warhammers.

You can use additional tags to describe your weapon and give it
character: well-balanced, fine craftsmanship, back scabbard, sharpened
and oiled, consecrated, etched dedication, and so on.

Coin

The exact amount of money your Hero is carrying is never tracked,
in the same way Heroes in stories rarely count their treasure coin
by coin. Your Hero is assumed to have monetary resources that are
reasonable for a person of their background and means, as reflected
in their themes and backstory. If they are journeying, their means
generally depend on what they had when they left home, what they
found since, and what they've spent.

Tags that represent valuables such as bag of gold or precious gem can
highlight your Hero's purchasing possibilities. You and the Narrator may
also use a financial status, such as hefty-purse or short-on-coin, to indicate
the temporary condition of your Hero having more or less to spend.

See buying and selling (page 185) for more about purchasing actions.

                                                                           I - H ero & F ellowship Creation  --  137

     As the last step before you set out on your journey, come
     together as a group and make some decisions about the                         WAR M F E E LI NG S
     nature of your Fellowship (if your Heroes aren't a Fellowship
     as such, you can use another name).                                                  admiring
                                                                                          amusing
     The Fellowship has its own theme and tags that are shared by                      bosom buddies
     all Heroes.                                                                     childhood friends

     The Fellowship Theme                                                                   flirty

     The Fellowship theme defines the nature of your band of Heroes and the                in love
     bond between them.                                                                good company
                                                                                      have their back
     Your Fellowship theme is just like your Hero themes. It consists of the             like family
     title tag and two more power tags, a weakness tag, and a Quest, which               soulmates
     represent your Fellowship's shared strong points, shared weaknesses,
     and shared goal. It can be improved, replaced, or evolved in the same way       BAD FEELINGS
     Hero themes do when you mark Improve, Abandon, or Milestone.
                                                                                            angry
     The Fellowship Theme is shared. Any Hero can invoke its tags when                    bad blood
     taking action, if its tags apply, and the Narrator may invoke its weakness         cannot relate
     tags for any Hero. Bigger choices are made as a group decision, such                cold to me
     as how to improve your Fellowship theme or when to mark Abandon
     or Milestone when you all feel the Fellowship Quest is betrayed or                    hatred
     accomplished.                                                                         jealous
                                                                                       makes me sad
     The Fellowship power tags are single-use. They are scratched when                    mocking
     you invoke them, and they cannot be burnt for Power (page 158). You                  offended
     can recover them as you would recover other power tags (page 154) or                prejudiced
     during camping (page 179).                                                           resentful

     Fellowship Relationships                                                        COOPERATION

     The Heroes' relationships with one another can have a deep impact over             appreciative
     the story. These relationships can be represented in several ways � for            coordinated
     example, your Hero could have a power tag dedicated to one of the other            domineering
     Heroes, or even an entire theme (such as Devotion).                                 mentoring
                                                                                          protective
     The individual relationships within the Fellowship are also represented
     with Fellowship relationship tags. These are single-use story tags that                 rival
     each Hero has for each other Hero. During a camp or sojourn, everyone               submissive
     in the Fellowship renews these tags with one another, or rephrases                  supportive
     them (Fellowship Quality Time, page 181). This way, the Fellowship              work well together
     relationship tags keep changing, reflecting developments in your
     relationships.                                                              IT'S COMPLICATED

     Optionally, the Narrator can allow Fellowship relationship tags to be              casual lovers
     treated as weakness tags of the Fellowship theme. This means that if            complicated past
     they are invoked negatively, the Fellowship gains Improve.                      leverage on them

                                                                                          indebted

Begin by brainstorming a concept for your group. This could involve
your Heroes' reason for coming together (a sense of duty, a common
enemy, pure greed), a commonality among all your members (trained by
the same master), or even just the place you all come from or frequent.

Then, create your Fellowship theme together, using one of the same
ways for creating your Hero's themes (page 77): simple, just coming
up with some tags; quick, picking a theme kit on page 141; or detailed,
answering questions from the Fellowship themebook on page 140.

Choose Fellowship relationship tags. List the names of the other Heroes
on your Hero card. For each Hero, pick one Fellowship relationship tag to
represent how your Hero feels about them, what they are to you, or what
you are to them � after confirming with that Hero's player.

Finally, play A Day In The Life We Once Knew, below.

"A Day In The Life We Once Knew"

The Prologue session, along with the process of creating your Hero and
Fellowship, ends with an exercise designed to flesh out the stories of the
Heroes, answer any open questions, and paint a picture of the Hero's life
before the beginning of the story.
� The Narrator picks a random time and day and asks each Hero:

  On an ordinary overcast day in the village of Ravenhome -
  Where are you now? What are you doing? Who are you with?

� Each player answers for their Hero.

  I'm at the forge, working on a horseshoe.
  I'm at my cabin, brewing a cure for a sickly boy.
  I'm angry. Someone let the goats out and they chewed up my garden.

� Everyone chimes in with questions and suggestions, adding details and
  making connections. Note it all down.

  Whose horse are you shoeing? A strange rider, coming from the east.
  What's the name of the boy? Renley. He's the hunter's boy.
  Who do you think it was? I bet ya it was Renley, the hunter's boy!

� Continue until you feel you have enough details about the Heroes' lives.

� This can be a good time to take a few actions and test out the rules, if
  you like.

Ready For Adventure!

You've finished setting up your story. In your next session, the Narrator
will begin by setting up a scene and so you'll embark on an adventure
together. Continue learning about the rules of the game in the next

   One Of Us: Choose an NPC accompanying the Fellowship � a person, animal, or any other thing that
   feels. All members of the Fellowship may write an additional Fellowship relationship tag with this
   character on their Hero cards.

   Sacrifice: When two or more of you suffer the same Consequences, a Hero who can reasonably defend
   another Hero may spend Power from their own reaction to lessen their ally's Consequences.

   Teamwork: When two or more Heroes take the same action while camping or sojourning, they all get 1
   more Power for this action.

   United by the Cause: Once per session, when the entire Fellowship cooperates in a single scene while
   aligned with this theme's Quest, each member of the Fellowship may unscratch a Fellowship theme tag.

 How to Play

                    WEAVING THE TALE

         Action & Drama

         It is time to set out on a journey and tell the story
                       of your Heroes, as they face perils and overcome
                       obstacles in pursuit of their Quests � be they as humble
                       as obtaining a neighbor's baking recipe or as grand as
          defeating the Dark Mistress herself.

           This game is played as a conversation. The rules come in to help introduce
           unexpected outcomes and exciting developments. They focus on the Heroes,
           their journey, and their cinematic moments -- what matters for your story --
           rather than the numerical values of their qualities.

           The rules are also intentionally layered. Choosing between Simple, Quick,
           and Detailed outcomes allow you to control the pace, tension, and balance
           between weaving a narrative and tactical gameplay.

Game Elements

In the tutorial (page 10), you've learned about these basic game
components:
� Story tags, impermanent tags that describe items, resources, and

  allies received during the game

� Statuses, special tags that describe temporary conditions and have
  a tier between 1 and 6

� Limits, the maximum tier of a status a Hero or Challenge can take
  before being overcome or before something dramatic happens

These elements will be mentioned throughout this chapter. They are
fully explained later in this chapter (starting on page 164).

                                                                           I I - Action & D rama  --          145

     THE GAME LOOP

     Your game is played in sessions, usually taking several hours. In every
     session you play through one or more scenes. Scenes can join together
     to form a story with a beginning, middle, and end, called an adventure,

     and multiple adventures can combine into longer sagas, known as a

     series or campaign, played over many sessions.

     In each scene, the Heroes take turns acting, and each turn plays

     through these three steps:

                           ESTABLISH
                         The Narrator presents the scene, describing:

                          � where your Heroes are and what is happening around them,

                     � what the stakes are (why your Heroes are there and why it matters),
                     � what the Challenges are (anything in your way to your goals), and

                        what Threats are posed to your Heroes or their goals, if any.
                        The Narrator then asks "What do you do?" and gives one Hero the
                        spotlight, so everyone is now listening to them.

     ACTION

     When your Hero is in the spotlight, you describe what your Hero is doing in

     the scene, responding to all that has been Established.

     The Narrator may choose one of three ways to determine the outcome of the

     action: rule what happened or give you further details about the scene (Simple),
     ask you to roll the dice (Quick), or ask you to roll the dice and, if you succeed,
     spend your Power on Effects according to your Hero's action (Detailed).

         CONSEQUENCES
         The Narrator delivers negative Consequences for your action if any of
         the following happened:
         � you ignored a Threat,
         � your roll generated Consequences,
         � the Narrator chooses to invoke your weakness tags for Consequences.

         The Narrator may add Effects.

         The Narrator may also allow you to lessen
         these Effects by making a reaction roll.

146  --  LEGEND IN THE MIST - VOL. I - THE HERO

These steps repeat. Following a Hero's Action and Consequences,            dhLoNCthveiioasnseentrcrtselsrrionnecaioqbgetkcuinoneaaeredngtr.,eEcToTfcesruhhostluerelafylyveodbeatrclntliooesysauhmto,ldhiudwenrerthgbeoHielcydehrir,oei.f
the Narrator re-establishes the scene and gives the spotlight to a
different Hero (if there are multiple Heroes), who then takes Action
and possibly generates Consequences.

Together, this cycle is called a turn. When all the Heroes have had
their turn, that's a round. These terms are only for convenience and
do not play a major role in the rules of the game.

The scene ends when the Narrator says so: whether there is nothing
else to do in the scene, all the Heroes left, or sometimes, for dramatic
flair. Usually, this happens when the stakes have been won, lost, or
deferred, and when all business in the scene has been concluded.

The Challenges that Stand in Your Way

Ultimately, in each scene, the Heroes attempt to reach their
goals by overcoming what stands in their way � the Challenges.
Depending on the story you tell and the specific scene, Challenges
can be anything, from monsters, through dangerous terrain,
to snoopy neighbours, or even having to craft a special gift for
someone's celebration.

Challenges act by making Threats against your Hero during
Establish and, if not stopped, by delivering Consequences. They
don't have their own turns. Before your turn, when Establishing
the scene, the Narrator says "the monster prepares to lunge at you!"
� that's a Threat, but it's still preventable. If you fail to stop this
Threat with your next action, the Narrator might say "the monster
snaps its jaws on your leg!" � these are the Consequences of not
addressing that Threat.

Challenges are overcome by taking action: either with a successful
Quick action or by taking a Detailed action and giving the Challenge
a status that meets or exceeds one of its Limits; it's the Narrator's
decision. When you're up against a Challenge, you can also take
action to understand its abilities (Threats & Consequences) and how
best to overcome it (Limits), again with either a Quick action or a
Detailed one to discover valuable details.

It's very rare for a Narrator to allow a Hero to overcome a Challenge
with a Simple action. Challenges are by definition dangerous and any
engagement with them has an uncertain outcome, and so a roll will
likely be involved.

SCENES WITH LOW OR NO STAKES

While the story is pushed forward by overcoming Challenges, many
times the Narrator will have the Heroes spend a scene just talking
with friends, or preparing themselves for future endeavours. In these
low-stakes scenes the game loop progresses as normal, but there
are no Threats, or only low-key ones. A camp or sojourn scene (page
179) also typically lack stakes.

                                                                           I I - Action & Drama  --                                                                                                                                       147

TAKING ACTION:
"WHAT DO YOU DO?"

As a player, your main role in the game is to listen to
the narration of the scene and then, when the spotlight
is yours, pick up the storytelling to describe what your
Hero is thinking and feeling, and ultimately what they are
driven to do � their action.

Describe Your Action

All Hero actions begin with a description,

by saying what you do.

You are not limited to any predetermined set of

of the story. Just like in a legend, your Hero can...

at a monster

(or drop a suspicious   you dream up.

      ingredient in)

What you describe is what your Hero is

trying to do; the Narrator and the rules of the
game help determine the actual outcome
of your action within your shared story.

  An action can take any length of
  time -- from the blink of an eye to
  several hours or more -- as long as
  fits the overall pace of the scene.

                                                                           I I - Action & Drama  --  149

     Next, the Narrator decides how to arrive at the outcome
     of your described action, choosing between three ways:

     THE SIMPLE WAY                                                                          SUCCESS
     The Narrator considers the situation, the Hero's tags,
     Challenges in the scene, the action's Might, and perhaps                  The action unfolds as
     factors yet unknown to your Hero.                                           expected, or better,

     The Narrator decides if the action ends with Success,                 achieving its intended goal
                                                                           or overcoming an obstacle.

Indirect tags are tags that are only somewhat relevant, or that feel
like a stretch to apply because they describe something too general.
They could affect the outcome, but something more is required to
make them impactful � an extra step.

To use them, you must first take a Detailed action and invoke
these indirect tags to create new tags or statuses that are directly
positive for your main action. For example, being resourceful doesn't
help you carry a barrel of fish, but you can use it to build or find a
wheelbarrow that would be directly helpful for carrying the barrel.
This type of action to create tags that will help another action is
called a prep action.

EXAMPLE ACTIONS & THEIR POWER

DISCOVER
You can discover by recalling lore, through a conversation, by
investigating the scene and searching for clues, or with a magic spell.
When you do, the Narrator gives you a valuable detail, relevant to
your subject and manner of inquiry. You can then ask a clarifying
question or two, but further details might need to be discovered with
more Power.

Alternatively, the Narrator may allow you to describe the valuable
detail your Hero has found, letting you co-create some of the secrets
of the story.

                                                                             I I - Action & Drama  --                                                                                                                                                                       155

           TAKING ACTION:
           DELVE DEEPER

           Success Grants A Narrative Shield

         When an action Succeeds, it is completed in the way the Hero
         intended and becomes true in your story: the Hero smites the ghoul,
         catches the miller's son falling from a cliff, or crafts a beautiful
         ebony figurine.

         This new `truth' prevents other, contradictory truths from
         happening.

         First, it cannot normally be reversed without a Consequence. If the
         Hero caught the falling miller's son, only a Consequence can make
         the Hero's grasp slip.

         Second, it is shielded from being reversed by Consequences for at
         least the duration of the turn, if not longer. If the Hero caught the
         miller's son, but the action generated Consequences, the Narrator
         cannot use that subsequent Consequence to nullify what was
         achieved and have the Hero drop the miller's son.

         Similarly, if a Hero successfully held back a swarm of imps with
         their massive shield, the Narrator cannot say the imps break through
         in the subsequent Consequence phase. The Narrator may choose to
         extend this "narrative shield" for a while longer, depending on the
         situation, giving the Success greater impact. In the next turn, they
         might say "despite scratches and screeches, you are still holding back
         those imps with your shield, for now." � thus temporarily putting on
         hold the Threat of the imps.

         The extra feat Effect (page 157) allows the Hero to add additional
         narrative truths to the main Success of a Detailed action at the cost of
         1 Power each. This can also be achieved in a Quick action by Pushing
         Your Luck (page 158) and achieving a Great Success. For example,
         the Hero that smote the ghoul can spend 1 Power to declare an extra
         feat of avoiding the ghoul's bite, preventing such a Consequence
         in that turn. The Hero who caught the miller's son can use a Great
         Success to pull the child back and away from the cliff, making sure
         he's safe for the rest of the scene.

         Heroes can use this "narrative shield" to block certain Threats
         from materializing into Consequences and to block specific
         Consequences. A Hero can Successfully bake cupcakes for everyone
         in the village to prevent a nasty rumor from spreading, and it will be
         so, for a while. Or a Hero can spend 1 Power on an extra feat when
         they cast a spell to ensure the spell does not exhaust them.

spend Power on Effects (page 154). The Narrator decides how much
Power the Hero has. If the action causes a helpful tag to be scratched,                Extra feat: ...and
that Power should be at least 3.                                                    immediately attack.

For example, if a Hero sips a Potion of Strength without nearby Threats,              Running away
the Narrator may give them 1 Power to spend to gain strengthened-1.                 Main Effect: Reduce
If the Hero gulps down the entire potion, scratching the tag, the
Narrator may give them 3 Power to spend to gain strengthened-3.                           catching-up
                                                                                 Extra feat: ...and close the

158  --  LEGEND IN THE MIST - VOL. I - THE HERO

  Making A Sacrifice

There are moments in your story when your Hero is
willing to put a lot at risk to achieve their wish: when a
Milestone on their Quest is finally within reach, or when
they want to stop someone they love from being harmed.

Making a sacrifice is a type of Quick outcome where you accept
certain severe Consequences to achieve something extraordinary.
However, unlike a normal Quick outcome, you do not add any Power
to your roll.

Describe your action and choose your level of Sacrifice: Painful,
Scarring, Grave.

The Narrator will say what you can achieve with a Success at this
level of sacrifice. You may still amend your Sacrifice or walk away.

Roll the dice. At the Narrator's option, they may tell you to add a
number to the total before you roll (Vol. II, page 78).
� If you rolled 10 or more, it is a Miracle.

  You Succeed and your Sacrifice is lessened by one level.

� If you rolled 7-9, it is Fate.
  You Succeed but pay in full the Consequences of your Sacrifice.

� If you rolled 6 or less, it is In Vain.
  You pay in full the Consequence of your Sacrifice, but nothing
  comes out of it, or things go terribly wrong. The Narrator may add
  further Consequences (especially Ill Tidings).

     STORY TAGS

     During play, your Hero may gain and interact with                          Shitgohrlyigthatgesd  are
     STORY TAGS, which are impermanent tags. Unlike your                                              in yellow.
     Hero's power and weakness tags, they can be either helpful
     or hindering depending on the situation, and they come                     Jug of Oil

     and go more easily. Story tags are recorded on tracking                    iagaHwLrwAtCoAwnihurcniohlivhedmlltlteniedreelseeehiiosnsyrttpistumnehoseetpwdorqrn,vaheAotwehuyetrydsehepercheneiesternthrttnet.athehcsaisthaTgsirbpeeevaloseleyshyorelHmnpyytneooat.ltttleearwihfhnehsNrAgywdaeoetdhetelalih'nhartsirNarareetyersselosmmaolaaytHprtwrptuetohcoraogesnsottearwaetkrilotiotecegsnotrhrst.
     cards or in the backpack section of your Hero card.

     Story tags are a versatile tool that can be used to describe many
     things in the game:

     � Items and beings your Hero creates, rallies, or summons, like a
       makeshift spear, local militia, or forest spirit

     � Qualities and abilities, whether new ones you bestow on others or
       those of your adversaries, like a aura of fire, curse of clumsiness, or
       invisibility

     � Things in the environment, like a bale of hay, heavy rain, or an
       ancient ward

     Story tags can be attached to anything, including your Hero, their
     allies, objects, Challenges, and the environment or the scene.
     Challenges often enter the scene already having some story tags.

     Story tags are temporary. They expire and are removed from play
     when they no longer make sense in the story, for example when a
     spell of protection has run its course or when you come in from the
     thick mist into a warm, well-lit tavern. Some might require effort to
     be removed, such as a curse of false visions.

     Using Story Tags

     � Story tags can be invoked in an action as either helping or
       hindering giving or taking away 1 Power accordingly. However,
       invoking a hindering story tags doesn't let you mark Improve,
       unlike weakness tags.

     � You can burn your Hero's story tags for Power (Drawing More
       Power, page 158). This is especially appropriate for story tags that
       represent consumable items.

     � You can create or scratch a story tag by spending 2 Power.

     � The Narrator can create or scratch story tags at any point, including
       during a player's action, although the adding of negative story
       tags (or the unwanted removal of story tags) is usually done as
       Consequences. You can lessen story tag Consequences by spending
       2 Power per tag.

164  --  LEGEND IN THE MIST - VOL. I - THE HERO

SINGLE-USE STORY TAGS
When spending Power, if you only have 1 Power left to spend, you may
create a single-use tag. This tag adds 1 Power to your roll, as normal, but
once invoked, it is scratched. Single-use story tags cannot be burned for
Power (Drawing More Power, page 158). Scratching a single-use story
tag costs 1 Power.

CONSUMABLE STORY TAGS
Consumable items represented by story tags may include potions and
remedies, food and other perishables, ingredients, scrolls and talismans
that burn when used, one-time graces booned by the gods, and such. When
a consumable item is consumed entirely in an action, the player should
burn its story tag for Power (page 158), to reflect the greater effect derived
from its one-time use. Consumable story tags can also be used normally to
provide 1 Power per tag, in which case it is assumed the Hero is rationing the
use of this consumable item to gain multiple uses with smaller effect.

Story Themes

You can make story tags into STORY THEMES by adding more tags to
them to describe their features. This makes whatever they describe more
important and more impactful in the story.

For example, a magic lantern can have additional tags such as reveals the dead
and dispel illusion, making the lantern especially useful for those activities.

The Narrator can add a negative story tag to round out a story theme,
such as the lantern being difficult to light. This is not a weakness tag, it
simply describes a flaw or an issue and is therefore usually hindering.
It can be removed with Effects, but as long as the theme remains, the
Narrator can reintroduce it.

EXAMPLE STORY THEMES
These examples mirror Hero themes by featuring two additional tags and
a negative one, but this is not a requirement.

     STATUSES

     Statuses are special tags that represent a character's                               Sifanotlnalgourtwmueeesbdneesbraa,ynrtdaehaedhirarigeshthileiagrhn. tded
     current conditions such as wounded or impressed. They
     have a tier indicating their intensity from 1, mild, to 6,                                Restrained
     which is deadly or transformative. Statuses are recorded
                                                                                                  x
     on tracking cards, by marking the numbered box
                                                                                          stSriheotpemurmaeetssiseeotlnvnaetstsudtCsahehnasatg, lellairekrnoeeugpseosi.soned,
     corresponding to their tier.

     Statuses can be used in myriad ways, such as:

     � To track wounds and injuries (bleeding, poisoned)
     � To compel other characters to act (convinced, charmed)
     � To show mood, feelings, and disposition (friendly, raging)
     � To represent tactical advantages and disadvantages (prone,

       distracted, off-balance)
     � To track progress, for example, of a ritual (progressing)
     � To boost (buff) your allies (blessed, hastened) and hinder (debuff)

       your foes (hobbled, drained)

     Statuses can be attached to anything, including your Hero, their
     allies, objects, Challenges, and the environment or the scene.
     Challenges often enter the scene already having some statuses.

     Statuses are temporary. They expire and are removed from play when
     they no longer make sense in the story, for example when a prone Hero
     was able to get up or when a humiliated evil queen had had enough time
     to restore her dignity. Some might require effort to be removed, such as
     wounded or cursed. A status that exceeds a Limit (page 169) becomes
     permanent.

� When you take action, you add the tier of the most helpful status
  to your Power and subtract the tier of the most hindering status
  from your Power.

� You can create statuses or reduce their tier (to the point of removing
  them if reduced to zero or below) by spending 1 Power per tier.

� The Narrator can create or remove statuses as Consequences. You
  can lessen such Consequences by spending 1 Power per tier. Some
  Challenges or environments can enter the scene already having
  some statuses.

Increasing Statuses (Stacking)

When a status already exists in the game, you increase its tier by
creating another status with the same or similar tag. For instance,
an opponent who is distracted-2 can be made even more distracted
by giving them a new distracted status. The Narrator rules on which
statuses stack and which exist independently; for example, wounded
and bleeding may stack, because they are similar.

When a stacking status is gained, add it to the same tracking card
by marking the box corresponding to its tier. The tier of a status is
always the highest box marked on its tracking card.

For example, if you already were distracted-2 (and marked the second
box) and then gained distracted-4, add a mark in the fourth box. The
new tier is 4.

168  --  LEGEND IN THE MIST - VOL. I - THE HERO

LIMITS

Every Hero and many Challenges have a Limit � a number                     Lcaimsnotinamnydaxlviitisiasmnsehrducaeiemeradfl.deso(Tl4hlpxoh)iawg.derheeesdlnnihgotbihtehyitlnedeasgdcenstain:hunmeribbreeder

If a Hero or Challenge takes a status with a tier equal to that

Limit, they are overcome (defeated) and cannot take any

more actions related to that status: if they are restrained,
they cannot move, and if they are humiliated, they cannot

speak in public. This is known as maxing out a Limit.

Limits can determine the outcome of a scene. If the Heroes
overcome the scene's Challenges, they may achieve their goals,
whereas if the Heroes are overcome, things can take a turn for the
worse for them.

If a status's tier ever exceeds a Limit, its effects are long-lasting
or permanent, spelling death or a deep transformation, when
appropriate.

Your Hero's Limit is always 5, for all statuses. At tier 6 your Hero
might die but could also instead be transformed or shaken to their
core. The Narrator may choose to change some of your themes and
associated tags to reflect the deep change your Hero underwent. For
example, if you were ostracized-6 by your village, perhaps you become
a Vagabond, or if you were killed-6 by a vampire, perhaps you become
one (Vampire).

Challenges have different Limits for different ways in which
they can be overcome. A wild boar could be hurt 4 , scared 4 ,
or bonded 4 with while a spirit of pestilence can be purged 5 and
appeased 3 . Some Challenges are immune to some statuses, listed
as having no maximum for that Limit. For example, the spirit of
pestilence may be immune to physical harm, or hurt � .

The Narrator is not required to reveal a Challenge's Limits to you �
your Hero usually has to take action in order to discover them.

Progress Limits

Limits can be used to track an impending turning This could be a desired outcome for the Heroes,

point in the narrative. These can be a process that such as completing the harvest in time and

must be completed, like a harvest, a journey, the                          knowing the village has food for the winter, or

crafting of a masterpiece, a ritual, a transformation; completing the delicate concoction of a special

invasion, or a room filling up with water. Such Limits an undesired outcome that is represented by

can trick the greatest sorcerer.

Similarly, some tasks demand more might than others. Whittling a
spoon from a piece of wood does not require as much skill as crafting a
magical ring, and climbing over a low stone wall cannot be compared
to climbing a towering, sheer mountain cliff with one's bare hands.

The Might rules given here allow you to represent situations in
which your Hero is Mightier than the task they are attempting, or
when the task they are attempting is beyond their Might. In these
situations, called Favored and Imperiled respectively, your Hero
receives a bonus or a penalty to the Power of their action and the
Consequences they take decrease or increase accordingly.

A TOOL FOR EMPHASIZING POWER GAPS
Like when counting Power (page 152), Might relies on the
Narrator's interpretation of the situation, the Hero's theme tags, and
the Challenge's Mighty aspects. The following guidelines help the
Narrator and Heroes envision what Might can be in your game, but
ultimately Might is a tool in the hands of the Narrator to signal to
the Heroes:

"Now you are in over your heads..." (Imperiled) or "Now your ability
can shine!" (Favored)

In doing so, the Narrator emphasizes the different power levels in
your story.

Determining Might

There are three broad levels of Might (for a more accurate scale, use
Detailed Might, page 177):

� Origin, for what is ordinary. This is the baseline Might of an
  ordinary person or task in all matters.

� Adventure, for what is exceptional.
� Greatness, for what can shape the world.

                                                                              I I - Action & Drama                                                                                                                                                                                --  171

     � Social influence, such as local, far-reaching, or realm-wide

     Might is always a combination of level and aspect. Adventure in
     influence, Greatness in magical power, Origin in money, Adventure
     in battle prowess, and so on.

     An individual often has not a single but several Mighty aspects.
     They may be Mighty (Adventure or Greatness) in some fields
     and ordinary (Origin) in others. A troll may have Mighty size and
     strength (Adventure in size), but may also be dirt-poor (Origin in
     money) or have no social clout (Origin in influence).

     A HERO'S MIGHT
     A Hero is Mighty in the aspects covered by their Adventure and
     Greatness themes, and in all other matters they are of Origin level.
     The King of the Riverlands (Greatness in influence), when attacked
     by an assassin in his bedchambers, is just a man (Origin in fighting),
     unless the king happens to have a relevant Mighty theme, such as
     Veteran of Many Battles (Adventure in fighting).

A Challenge's Mighty aspects are determined by the Narrator, or
listed in the Challenge Profile (Vol. II, page 106). An archmage can
possess all-powerful magic (Greatness in magic), a giant is Mighty
big (Adventure in size), while a scheming royal advisor can be
difficult to outsmart (Adventure in cunning). In all other aspects, the
Challenge is at Origin level.

AN ACTION'S MIGHT

An action is Mighty if it requires exceptional (Adventure) or
world-shaping (Greatness) ability to accomplish. For example,
building a boat fit for a dozen people (Adventure in crafting) is a
Mighty endeavor due to its size and the expertise required. Fighting
a militia platoon (Adventure in numbers) is an exceptional feat for a
lone ordinary swordsman, while fighting an entire army (Greatness
in numbers) all lonesome is nothing short of legendary.

Engaging a Challenge directly in their Mighty aspect is an equally
Mighty action. Attacking an ogre (Adventure in size) in hand-to-
hand combat, assuming they can use their physical size in battle, is
a task fitting Adventure level battle prowess. Verbally challenging
the grand vizier in court (Greatness in influence) is a task that calls
for Greatness in social clout or oratory skill. Trying to shatter the
magical sigil of a lich (Greatness in magic) is a task that calls for
Greatness in magic.

IMPERILED
A Hero taking an action one level of Might greater
than they possess (Origin vs. Adventure, or Adventure
vs.Greatness) is taking an Imperiled action. They
either fail (Simple), or lose 3 Power (Quick, Detailed)
in addition to all other counted tags and statuses.

This penalty does not apply to reactions. Instead, if the
Hero takes Consequences from a source one level of
Might greater than they, the Narrator increases the
Effects of the action's Consequences by 3 status tiers
or one tag.

In the extreme case the Hero is two levels of Might below
what is needed (Origin vs. Greatness), they are Extremely
Imperiled: their action loses 6 Power, and they take
Consequences increased by 6 status tiers or 3 tags.

FAVORED
A Hero taking an action one level of Might lower than
they possess (Adventure vs. Origin or Greatness vs.
Adventure) is taking a Favored action. They either
succeed (Simple), or gain 3 Power (Quick, Detailed) in
addition to all other counted tags and statuses.

This bonus does not apply to reactions. Instead, if the
Hero takes Consequences from a source one level of
Might lower than they, the Narrator decreases the
Effects of the action's Consequences by 3 status tiers or
one tag. This could potentially nullify the Consequences.

In the extreme case the Hero is two levels of Might above
what is needed (Greatness vs. Origin), they are Extremely
Favored: their action gains 6 Power, and they take
Consequences decreased by 6 status tiers or 3 tags.

Detailed Might (Scale)

The Narrator may choose to use a more detailed version
of Might, also called Scale.

Using this method, the Might required for an action is counted based on
the action's difficulty and the scale of its effect, such as the area it covers
or the number of people it includes, to come up with a more exact figure
for the Might required for an action.

THE ACTION'S MIGHT
Use the Scale table as guidance. Pick an Area, Size, or Numbers
description that best describes the action's scope. This Might value is
subtracted from the action's Power. You can combine Might values
from different columns.

CAMPING
& SOJOURNS

When the Fellowship stops to recover their strength or to admire the
view in between scenes of travel, drama, and adventure, the flow of scenes

pauses for a while and you take a break: a camping scene. In this scene,

you describe what each Hero is doing around camp in broad strokes,
although you may zoom in on interesting details.

Similarly, there are times in the series when the Fellowship spends a longer sojourn
somewhere, staying for days, weeks, or even months. Perhaps they are staying
with the Fair Folk, learning their mysterious ways, crafts, and magic, or
maybe they spend time in an ally's welcoming manor house. They could
be simply passing the time in their own home hamlet between their local
adventures.

Expire Story Tags In Your Backpack

A pause for camping or sojourning often means a significant length of time
passes. This is a convenient moment for you and the Narrator to review the
story tags in your backpack (as well as other story tags, if any) and expire
some of them, although the Narrator may rule they persist until the end of
the camping scene, or even beyond � all according to what fits the story.

To keep the benefits of expired story tags going forward, you must
recreate them, either during your camping or sojourn, or later, by
taking action in a scene.

TYPES OF EXPIRATION
Some story tags represent things that truly expire: a numbing
salve has lost its properties, or a peddler ally must part with you
and go their own way. Recreating their tags means making new
instances of these things � make a new batch of salve, make a
new friend.

Other story tags represent things that must be
maintained to retain their usefulness: you must practice
your battle stance again or you won't perform it well next
time, you must repair your boots or they won't be of much
use. Recreating these tags means bringing them back to
working order.

Finally, some story tags represent things that remain
in the story, but lose their importance and power to affect
it. You may have looted a dagger from a dead body, but �
unless you make it into a power tag � the dagger is not a
permanent fixture in your Hero's story. Your Hero may
still possess the dagger, but actions with the dagger
will no longer gain Power from it. You can prolong the
importance of such things by recreating the same tag.

                                                                           I I - Action & Drama  --  179

                       be deeply changed by the events of their journey.
                       The choices you make in the story drive your Hero's
                       development in different ways. When you choose to
         pursue one path, you inevitably abandon another.

         Overcoming great difficulties, you may reveal new abilities or
         take some aspect of your Hero's life to a new scale or level. What
         matters to your Hero on the fateful day their journey begins may
         seem unimportant later on, as they emerge into a greater, more
         dangerous, and more mysterious world, although, in the end, they
         may come to understand the true importance of the little things.

     Your Hero's Quests may fall into one or more of the following
     categories. When you try to decide whether to mark Abandon or a
     Milestone, follow these guidelines.

     YOUR WISH
     Something you long for or aspire to. This is the classic Quest � your
     desire to achieve something far away and out of reach, even if it is
     merely winning the heart of the cobbler's son who lives next door.

     Example: I must bring an end to the rule of the Wurm Tyrant.

     Mark Abandon whenever you are presented with an opportunity to
     advance toward your wish but miss it or forego it.

     Mark a Milestone whenever you make a significant step toward
     achieving your wish.

     YOUR TRUTH
     A statement you believe in and want to uphold. This type of Quest
     is about a belief or conviction that you feel strongly about and wish to
     live by, such as a moral code or, conversely, a prejudiced belief.

     Example: I shall always stand by the code of chivalry!

     Mark Abandon whenever you act in a way that goes against your
     truth or that acknowledges its falsehood or partiality.

     Mark a Milestone whenever you resist a significant temptation to
     spurn your truth or when you reassert your truth dramatically, to
     yourself or to the world.

     YOUR HOME
     Something you endeavor regularly to preserve. This type of Quest
     is about maintaining a status quo, something you love or that you're
     used to. It is your Hero's inner 'home', where they wish to stay, what
     they want to keep.

     Example: Farming is tough, but it is our life.

     Mark Abandon whenever you fail to fulfill what is needed to preserve
     your home � whether a ritual, a chore, or a duty.

     Mark a Milestone whenever you reinforce your home in a new and
     significant way.

Something you yearn to know above all. Some Quests are a mystery
that you want to unravel. It could be the identity of the one who burned
down your village, or answers to the greatest mysteries of creation.

Example: What is the malignance that infects the eastern wetlands?

Mark Abandon whenever you have a chance to discover something
new about your question, but you ignore or forego it.

Mark a Milestone whenever you find significant new answers to your
question.

Writing Out Your Milestones

You can assign in-game goals to each Quest's three Milestones to help
you envision your Hero's path and guide their actions:

Quest: I must bring an end to the rule of the Wurm Tyrant.
� Milestone 1: Discover the origin of the Wurm's sorcery.
� Milestone 2: Find something or someone that could resist it.
� Milestone 3: Shatter the source of its power.

You may wish to keep these annotated Milestones to yourself,
or share them with the Narrator or the group. Your Hero may be
outspoken about their next goals, or there may even be a three-part
prophecy about them.

Either way, your envisioned milestones are not binding for you nor
for the Narrator � your journey can unfold in many unexpected ways.
Whenever the story takes a different turn of events, you can revise
your goals or set new ones.

                                                                           I I - H ero Development  --                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               189

     When you mark the third Milestone on a theme, you evolve it.             eyayaIoytcccQaQYttdanoohouhhhoonpnenonuuuuuutdpepeooudeeobrrtleooerrsstdbnptlahnnussottehvhhyreQteee,n'patddiseviatlesrrunivmyrlrettlnmnaedutieeeoecrooaohgsgldfussuseeytntoeteaosree;sihoyertmis.mlembsotovmnm.tuetpFahehruoaeaaFmelaaddown,ayeertkoofyyfar,rrrcdisiheorerwfoayepobcereaenebigeeintrlocxetcvixtsisexorhtenmeaeohphfanwhfpisdilgmyeoliseosvml,naoiodtarooeppyeutpmooussipescueomltorsrttueleetdouieemyieh,dopsrvr,yoaiondethateoouidfey,fluy.v.n'ed

     theme, is now either the cocoon out of which a new aspect emerges        ranger.
     or the solid ground upon which a new theme is built. Your theme
     may evolve in an expected way, such as perfecting your trade into a
     renowned profession, or in a completely unexpected direction, such
     as using the little gold you accumulated from your trade in order to
     buy a suit of armor and become a knight.

     Evolving a theme could mean:
     � You are taking your Quest to a new level or scale, larger or smaller.

     � You have completed your Quest and you are now available to focus
       on something else.

     � You've failed your Quest, but you've never abandoned it. In time,
       what you've learned will evolve into a new direction for you.

     When you evolve a theme, it changes, but you have a choice of
     keeping some aspects of your old self. Follow these steps:
     � Mark Promise (page 193), once. Every change of themes earns

       one Promise, reflecting the deeper impact left on your Hero from
       going through this transformation.

     � Pick a new title tag for this theme, one that reflects its evolution.

     � Choose a new theme type, or change the Might of the theme. It
       cannot stay the same as it was.

     � Revise your power tags and weakness tags as needed to reflect
       how they evolved, or replace them altogether with new tags. You
       may keep them as they are if they fit the new theme.

     � Revise your Quest to fit your new theme.

     � Trade unwanted parts of your old theme for new improvements.
       You may trade each power tag beyond the third, each weakness
       tag beyond the first, and each Special Improvement to gain an
       Improvement for your new theme (Improving a Theme, page
       187). You may use this improvement as usual to mark Promise. You
       may also keep your old theme's Special Improvements, if you wish.

     EXPANDING A THEME
     When you would evolve a theme, you can choose to instead "expand"
     it, so it'll take even more of your priorities: Replace one of your
     other themes with a new one that expands on the evolved theme. If
     you choose to do so, also reset the Milestone tracker on the evolved
     theme and rewrite its Quest.

     For example, a Hero who evolves their Cook of Delicacies (Skill or
     Trade) theme could choose to replace Frivolous (Personality) with
     My Own Tavern (Possessions), while still keeping Cook of Delicacies
     unchanged.

 The Secret
 of Magic

            Fundamentals
              of Magic

         The basic game elements of Legend In The Mist �
                      themes, tags, statuses, etc. � support a wide variety
                      of magical traditions and methods. This section
                      explores the flexibility of these tools when applied to
         magic in your game.

         Magic can also go much further. Starting on page 206,

         you will find eight optional Ways Of Magic, sets of rules

         that emulate the feel and effect of common magical arts and
         abilities found in legend such as alchemy, runic invocations, or
         ritualistic witchcraft.

Describe tools and ingredients that empower your magic. To
invoke these tags, you must be able to use the items they describe,
such as hold a wand or inhale special incense.

You and the Narrator may associate specific items with specific kinds
of magic to focus these tags; for example, burning mugwort may help
cleansing and divination, but not with punishing curses. Otherwise,
item tags may be considered indirect and require a prep action to
support specific use, such as becoming empowered by raising your
staff before casting a spell.

 I What skill related to your Magic have you developed?

 J What social skill, trait, or benefit do you have thanks to your Magic?

Describe aspects of your magic that are not directly related to
using magic. These tags are not directly helpful for magic actions
(except in rare situations), but they connect your magic to other
aspects of your Hero and to the world. These tags help in related
actions such as identifying and understanding magic, researching
magic (including prep actions to create specific magic ability tags,
when applicable) or general lore related to your magic.

                                                                         affecting magic actions directly.

         Magical Quests

         Your Quest can represent magical limitations, requirements, or goals
         related to your Hero's magic.

         WISH: ARCANE ASPIRATIONS
         A Quest can represent something you seek in order to grow your
         magical power or a goal related to your magic. If you turn your back
         on opportunities to find it three times (mark Abandon), you turn
         your back on the potential of your magic. If you persist in your search
         and sacrifice more and more to find what you seek (mark Milestone),
         you will become more powerful than ever before.
         � Your interest in arcane knowledge.

         � Your ambition in the pursuit of a source or sources of magical power.

         � Your desire to cultivate or achieve a new state of being or
           consciousness.

         � Your search after special ingredients or a unique magical item.

         TRUTH: MAGICAL TABOOS
         A Quest can be a magical law or taboo you must never cross. If you
         cross it three times (mark Abandon), you will lose your magical
         ability. If you pass three tests of temptation, resisting the urge to
         cross the line (mark Milestone), you unlock the true meaning behind
         it and deepen your magic.
         � The ways of your magical practice, such as rules for conducting

           yourself or the manner in which you must face the world.

         � The ethos or saying practitioners of your kind of magic hold
           themselves to.

         � The one line you won't cross with your magic.

         � A binding magical maxim, dictum, or rule you must hold to.

         � The demand of a deity, force, or creature that grants you your magic.

         HOME: NECESSARY RITUALS
         A Quest can describe something you must do regularly to keep your
         magic. If you fail to perform this task or ritual three times (mark
         Abandon), your magic will be gone. If you perform this duty or
         requirement three times, each more diligently or impressively than
         before (mark Milestone), you will tap a deeper well of power for
         your magic.
         � What you must do to keep your magic functioning, to replenish

           your power, or keep your magic honed.

         � The activity you engage in that connects you to the source of your
           magic or the community that supports you.

         � The wondrous or terrible thing you must do to keep hold of your
           arcane power or grow it.

204  --  LEGEND IN THE MIST - VOL. I - THE HERO

QUESTION: INITIATED INTO THE MYSTERIES
A Quest can call upon you to explore deeper into your magic or its source.
If you are invited to discover more but renounce this invitation three times
(mark Abandon), you renounce the mystery and your power will wane.
If you make three sacrifices of a part of yourself to immerse deeper and
deeper in the mysteries (mark Milestone), you will reveal profound truths
and with them greater magic.

� Seeking to understand the mysterious will of a deity or creature that
  grants you your magic.

� A mystical question about creation and the deeper or higher forces that
  shape it.

� A dive into the depths of your own being, or the hidden truths behind
  your power.

Consequences Of Magic Actions

When magical actions generate Consequences, the Narrator may use
them to reflect the various outcomes of using magic.

� Collateral Damage: Magic is dangerous to everyone around. Someone
  close to you can be physically harmed by your magic (wounded, drained,
  or burned), or they may be transformed, corrupted, or cursed (either as a
  status or with tags such as unrecognizable face, unbearable stench, stunted
  arm, enfeebled mind, etc.)

� Divulging Information (Exposure): Using magic can attract unwanted
  attention. If it's flashy or performative you may expose your position,
  identity, or intentions. Other magic users might be able to sense your
  power, or learn something about your magic from watching you.

� Expenditure: Magic can be taxing, causing you to become exhausted,
  drained, or dizzy. It can also consume a resource such as ingredients or mana.

� Harm: Sometimes using magic hurts you, making you bleed, breaking an
  object you need (scratch a tag), or making you more and more cold-hearted.

� Imperfect Execution (Blocked; Yes, But): The magical arts are
  unreliable at best. A spell can gutter and falter just when you think you
  had it, leaving you with only half of the desired effect � or less.

� Loss of Advantage: Using magic involves taking a risk, and sometimes
  the distraction or sheer demand of the spell could mean you are no
  longer holding a superior position or feeling confident.

� Side Effects (Blocked; Ill Tidings): Unexpected outcomes can come
  from using magic. A doorway to another realm can suddenly appear, or
  someone could grow a forked tail all of a sudden.

� Unintended Threats (New Challenge): Magic can call forth forces
  unseen, cause an avalanche, or allow demons to enter the mortal
  realm, putting you and those around you under Threat.

� Wasted Time: Magic, especially ritual magic, can be lengthy and
  laborious. While you are working on your spell, time-passes and things
  happen around you: trouble brews, enemies advance, and conditions
  worsen.

                                                                           I I I - F undamentals of M agic  --  205

           Way of Magic

         Alchemy & Herbalism

         WITH NAUGHT BUT A MORTAR AND PESTLE, ONE
         MAY UNLOCK THE MOST POTENT OF ESSENCES.

         Alchemy and herbalism are related arts that involve the
         finding, extracting, and combining of special properties present
         in natural and supernatural plants, organs, and materials,
         preparing them into wondrous concoctions that can treat
         wounds or render skin hard as stone. Many villages and remote
         communities rely on these practices for their everyday needs,
         while masters of these arts can refine even the spirit itself.

         Collecting Recipes

         (Magic Is Collected)

         Recipes for concoctions are hard to come by and even harder to
         invent or discover. Every alchemist or herbalist has a list of their
         known recipes, which are often recorded in a thick tome or a sheaf of
         scribbled notes. A player keeps this list of known recipes along with
         the Hero's cards or sheet. The recipe itself is not a tag.

         A ready-to-use concoction is represented by a tag (healing poultice,
         deadly poison), which is either a power tag in the theme or created as
         a story tag when the herbalist prepares the concoction (see below).
         Herbalists can only create concoctions for which they have recipes;
         if they want to expand the list, they must find recipes or trade for
         them, or invest time and effort in developing new ones.

         Each setting might have some of these recipes or others. In most
         settings, these recipes are the result of collective generational
         wisdom and expertise handed down throughout the years.

         Some of these recipes might have names that are different from their
         application � for example, a healing salve might be called sunroot
         salve, representing a common ingredient, and owl vision drops might
         be called night faerie's gift, stemming from a folk story about the time
         it was first acquired many generations ago. In such a case, record
         the benefit of the recipe in parentheses: sunroot salve (healing), night
         faerie's gift (owl vision).

         Concocting

         (Magic Requires Preparation)

         Alchemists and herbalists craft concoctions in a safe environment, while
         camping or sojourning (Advance Preparation). Crafting is a magic action
         that creates a story tag from the list of the practitioner's known recipes.

         Concoction story tags are kept in the backpack and can be shared
         like any other item. Power tags can represent concoctions that you
         regularly prepare and carry with you.

            THE WHIMSICAL FAIR FOLK BOON MERCURIAL
            MAGIC AS QUICKLY AS THEY TAKE IT AWAY. BASK
            IN THEIR FLEETING WONDER WHILE IT LASTS.

         When mortals find themselves the object of attention of
         one of the Fair Folk, they will occasionally be granted
         mysterious, bewildering enchantments of the other realm
         � by choice, through a pact, or perhaps unwillingly or
         unwittingly. The magic of the Fair Folk is as fickle as the
         beings that bestow it, waxing and waning according to
         their favor � and leaves its capricious mark on those who
         avail themselves of it.

       The Magic of The Fair Folk

           To those familiar with their ways, the fey are known to possess
           magics such as:
           � Enchanting items with speech, or abrupt powers of flight
           � Charms of shapeshifting and illusion, often called `glamors'
           � Charms of trickery, deception, or self-aggrandization
           � Manipulation of one's grasp, the senses, and the waking or

             dreaming mind
           � Shrinking and enlarging of unusual items
           � Unexplained means of transportation from place to place, or `fairy

             roads'
           � Healing, but also intoxication; invigoration or conversely sapping

             and weakening
           � Cryptic foretellings, often more confusing than helpful

       Unexpected and Fickle

           (Magic is Fickle)

           Those touched by the Fair Folk find that their magic grows stronger
           and weaker as their patron's opinion of them sways. A polar status,
           fey's-favor / fey's-disapproval, tracks this attitude, and helps or hinders
           all magic actions using the magic of the fey patron.

           The Narrator may update this status following any action strongly
           aligned or opposed with the patron's preferences (without the Hero's
           ability to lessen it). It is in the best interest of the fey-touched who
           wish to keep their magical boons to identify their patron's preferences
           and stick to this kind of behavior � although the fey are notoriously
           capricious, and often change their minds. For most practitioners
           and patrons, trying to curry favor with their patron is an Imperiled
           action, if not Extremely Imperiled.

   MAGIC OF THE HOUSEHOLD HOB (ORIGIN)

Sometimes an old house or a family with a history with the fey has a small fairy or spirit
caring for the home and protecting it. A member of that household can befriend the hob
and call upon its handy powers, so long as they are within the home or its grounds. Hobs
are notoriously grumpy and easy to offend, and can turn mean and even darkly violent if
an affront is not remedied.

         Runic Invocation

         ANCIENT GLYPHS AND WORDS OF POWER CALL
         FORTH FORCES UNSEEN, UNLEASHING THEIR
         POWER UPON THE MORTAL REALM.

         The practice of runic invocation involves accessing magic
         powers through knowledge of arcane symbols and words,
         applying them through a deep understanding or feeling of
         their eldritch meaning. Some inscribe runes to empower
         objects, while others invoke them openly as magic spells.
         Each rune has its own meaning; the most powerful runic
         invokers master many such runes.

         Obtaining Runes

         (Magic Is Collected)

         Runes are the alphabet or words of an ancient language deeply tied
         to the fabric of Creation. Each rune's magical ability is determined by
         its meaning in the lost language. The tag for each rune represents the
         meaning of the specific rune, such as "ward", "fire", or "throw".

         Runes are hidden, scattered throughout the world. Some are in
         hard to reach places, while others have been found and are kept as
         a guarded secret. Once a runic invoker finds and deciphers a rune,
         they need to train using it in conjunction with other runes or spend
         time contemplating its meaning. When they have a strong grasp of
         the rune, they may add it to their magic theme as a power tag. Runes
         cannot ordinarily be represented as story tags, unless a special way is
         devised to store the power of a rune without understanding it.

         Invoking Runes

         (Magic Is Synergetic, Magic Imposes Constraints)

         When taking magic actions of runic invocation, the invoker must
         draw or scribe one or more runes, whose tags they must possess and
         invoke when counting Power. Normally, the invoker must be able
         to somehow chart the rune, whether in the air or on an object or
         person, or they must be able to speak it; casting runic spells is not
         possible without one or the other (narrative principle).

         The resulting effect is a combination of the meanings of the runes
         invoked. For example, "throw" and "fire" can be invoked together to
         throw a flaming projectile. Since each known rune is a power tag, the
         more runes the invoker combines in the final effect, the more Power
         the magic action will have, but also the more specific its effect will be.

RUNIC THEME TAGS
The title tag of a Magic theme of runic invocation can be a general              "strike", "sun", "throw", "time",
magical ability tag such as Runescribing, in which case it can be             "truth", "unmake", "void", "weaken",
invoked in every magical action performed by the invoker as long as
at least one rune tag is also invoked. It represents general aptitude,              "weapon", "wolf ", "wood"
but cannot be used in magic actions on its own.

Alternatively, the title tag can already include the first and main rune
learned by the invoker. For example, Blazing Invoker ("fire"). This
specialization allows the invoker to take magic actions with their title
tag alone, but it only applies to magic actions that involve its runic word.

Variant: Consumable Runes

(Magic Is Prepared, Magic Requires Extra Effort, Magic Is Spent
When Used)

With this variant, a rune can be inscribed on impermanent materials
(scrolls, talismans, or even one's skin) by those who know them, and
later invoked by others who may not have complete understanding
of the rune.

Inscribing a rune is a magic prep action that creates a rune story tag,
such as "conceal" ofuda talisman or "strength" tattoo, which is stored
in the Hero's backpack. This action requires knowing the rune as a
power tag, and has the inherent negative tags requires tools,

  requires concentration, and requires time.

When the rune's owner (or anyone who can read the rune, at the
Narrator's discretion) takes a magic action that invokes the rune, they
may use the story tag as if it were a runic power tag. However, they must
scratch the story tag after it is invoked and cannot burn it for Power
(the Low Magic variant). An invoker may combine their known runes
(power tags) with such temporary runes (story tags) in a magic action.

216  --  LEGEND IN THE MIST - VOL. I - THE HERO

  Way of Magic

Shapeshifting

ONE'S FORM IS A BRITTLE ILLUSION THAT CAN
BE MOLDED OR SHED TO REVEAL TRUE POWER --
AT THE RISK OF LOSING ONE'S MIND.

Taking new shapes or bodies, either as an innate ability
or as an art, is a power possessed by many legendary
creatures and sorcerous magic practitioners. While
retaining their conscious mind, shapeshifters can change
their physical form or possess a new one and become
endowed with fantastical strength and abilities. Yet all
shapeshifters risk losing control and succumbing to a
form's primal instincts. Some eschew this control entirely;
others develop it and become more versatile and refined.

Changing Shape

(Optional: Magic Requires Preparation)

If the shapeshifter already possesses the tags for the new form
(either as power tags or as story tags prepared in advance), the
change is usually a Simple action that does not end a Hero's spotlight
(unless it is somehow uncertain or hindered, or the change is
particularly slow).

If the shapeshifter is transforming into a new form for which they
have no tags, then the change is a magic prep action that is used to
create a story tag representing the new form. Additional story tags
represent further features and abilities of the new form, forming a
story theme. The Narrator may add a negative story tag to round out
the theme as usual.

Changing back into the shapeshifter's original form is also a Simple
action, unless it is somehow resisted (see the instinct status below),
in which case it should be resolved as a Quick action.

         Sorcery

         WREATHED IN THE SURGING THREADS OF THE
         SHROUDED FABRIC OF OUR WORLD, A SORCERER
         MAY MAKE TRUE THEIR WILDEST DREAMS WITH
         BUT A WORD.

         Sorcery is the secret art of drawing, intertwining, and
         releasing the magical threads of reality to shape it in
         marvelous and terrifying ways. Its practice requires
         arcane knowledge, most of which is lost to time, as well as
         discipline, precision, and always � a mote of the sorcerer's
         own life force. In return, sorcerers channel incredible
         power through their spells, limitless in its potential
         and versatility, and at the same time dangerous in its
         catastrophic backlash.

         Powerful One-Time Incantations

         (Magic Is Spent When Used)

         A sorcerer casts spells � single-use magical surges that have great
         power. Whenever a spell is cast, the Hero must burn its tag for
         Power, starting each spell at 3 Power instead of 1 but making
         spellcasting a seldom-used affair. Spells therefore are usually
         represented by a specific tag, but if a sorcerer has no specific tag
         to burn, they may burn a broader tag instead (such as their Magic
         theme title tag).

         Spell tags can be part of a Magic theme, representing practiced

         spells memorized in advance, or stored in items such as scrolls or
         magic rings. Spell power tags are recovered as normal, as well as
         through camp Rest, and a spellcaster can have tags such as spell recall
         to help recover lost spell tags quicker.

         SPONTANEOUS SPELL

         Sorcerers can also attempt a more spontaneous form of spellcraft by
         taking a prep action to make a new spell tag on the spot (often using
         their Magic theme title tags and other broad tags) and then cast the
         spell by burning the new spell tag. This prep action does not incur
         the risks of casting a spell (see below), but the Narrator may rule it

           requires some time, especially if the spell is complicated.

Sorcery Exerts A Toll

(Magic Carries a Price)

A sorcerer uses their own life force to weave a magic spell. As an
inherent Consequence whenever a spell is cast (magic action or
reaction), the sorcerer becomes drained-1, a status which hinders
all magic actions, as well as other forms of mental and physical
exertion.

This Consequence can be lessened as normal. Sorcerers may possess
abilities or items that specifically help them lessen the exhaustion or
recover from it quickly, such as enduring spirit or vial of mana.

Sufficient rest (including Resting while camping) can restore the
sorcerer's energy and expire the status.

Complex Spellcasting

(Magic Requires Extra Effort)

The sorcerer must use the correct hand gestures and magic words
in order to cast the spell. This process is delicate and requires focus
and concentration. As such, all sorcery spells have the inherent
negative tags requires incantation, requires hand gestures, and requires
concentration; if any of these are absent, the spell is weakened and
the risk of failure increases. Sorcerers can train in techniques that
counter these requirements by choosing tags such as silent spell,
motionless spell, and a mind of steel.

Hazardous Botch

As a typical Consequence, a spellcasting action that does not result
in a Success may still cast the spell but with unintended results. The
Narrator should determine the Effects of the Consequences based on
the Power of the spellcasting action � the more powerful the botched
spell, the harsher the mishap.

Variant: Corruptive Sorcery

(Magic Carries a Price)

Magic is a forbidden practice that twists the sorcerer's soul. Instead
of paying with life energy, sorcerers are corrupted by magic, taking
corrupted-1 as an inherent Consequence of spellcasting (they may
attempt to lessen it if they have the means).

Corruption does not expire on its own: removing corrupted can be
done only with the right restorative magic, often a feat beyond the
power of corruptive sorcery. When corrupt exceeds its maximum
(above tier 5), the Narrator alters the Hero's themes and tags, making
them inhuman and evil.

Spirit Binding

OUR WORLD IS SHAPED BY PRESENCES
BEYOND SIGHT, SOME GRACIOUS AND SOME
MALEVOLENT. LEARN TO MASTER THEM AND
YOU SHALL MASTER ALL THINGS.

The art of spirit binding seeks to understand and
command the personified yet often invisible forces
inhabiting and shaping the world. These "spirits" are
everywhere, in the natural world as well as in human
dwellings and settlements, and beyond, in other realms.
Spirit binders often learn to interact with and bind a
certain kind of spirit; experienced and knowledgeable
practitioners hold sway over many spirits.

Locating and Binding Spirits

(Magic Requires Preparation)

"Binding" is a general term for many different approaches. A
practitioner may befriend a spirit, appease it with offerings, contain
it with mystical wards and then force it to comply, offer their own
body as the spirit's host, or completely subjugate the spirit by
invoking higher forces related to its origin.

Each spirit has its own origin, abilities, and agendas. Understanding,
finding, and identifying spirits to bind is the first step in the work of a
spirit binder. A spirit binder may take action, magical or not, to gain
access to such spirit (e.g., mystically sensing nearby spirits or simply
conversing with a visible spirit). Many spirit binders become good
communicators and investigators in order to figure out which spirits
are available for them to bind.

Binding a spirit is a magic prep action, which creates story tags
representing the spirit and its abilities. The first story tag created must
be the name of the spirit. Additional story tags represent the spirit's
specific abilities, forming a story theme. The Narrator may add a
negative story tag to round out the theme as usual. When a binder binds
a spirit, they may also spend Power to have it manifest already in a
specific state by giving it a status such as friendly or flaming.

                                                                             I I I - Ways of M agic  --  223

          STORY THEMES
                                    Once the spirit's story tag is in the binder's possession, the binder is
                Grandpa Lo          considered to be in control of the spirit and can use its tags in ally

                                    will, unless a tag or a status indicates it is inclined to persist on its own.
                history lesson
               easily sidetracked   The bound spirit will perform actions that are opposed to its own
                                    will, and even to its own survival. However, as a typical Consequence
             Will O' The Wise       of these actions, the spirit might become defiant, unhelpful, or even
               guide to safety      vengeful, representing its resistance to keep acting against its will. A
                  misdirect         spirit might also break free of the binder's control, freeing it to escape
                  mischievous       or retaliate (New Challenge). Alternatively, these emotional statuses
                                    could be tracked against a break-free Limit; when it is maxed, the

             only aids true rulers  disoriented-1. This status hinders almost every action that relies on
                                    senses or physical actions, as the binder's body does not submit to
                                    their will. To reduce disoriented, the binder must spend some time
                                    resting and indulging in simple pleasures, which moors their spirit
                                    back in the body.

                                    Alternatively, binding a spirit allows its nature to influence the
                                    binder. Some nature spirits affect your personality to match their
                                    own (bestial). Binding spirits of disease or death directly drains your
                                    vitality (weakened). Spirits that represent human ideals demand your
                                    submission (obedient). Some types of spirits may attempt to possess
                                    the binder (possessed). Each of these hinders different actions, and
                                    can be removed in different ways.

                                    Binding Challenge Spirits

                                    Challenges that are spirits can also be bound by a practitioner
                                    with the right know-how.

                                    The binder must first successfully banish or appease the
                                    spirit, showing their power over it. Then, if they choose to
                                    attempt to bind it, the Narrator adds a bind Limit.
                                    When maxed, the binder gains Power equals to the sum of the
                                    banish (or appease ) Limit and the bind Limit to spend
                                    on story tags for the spirit.

       Witchcraft Rituals

           (Magic Requires Extra Effort, Magic Can Be Empowered)

           Witches conduct long and elaborate rituals in order to hex, bewitch,
           and enchant. These rituals can achieve powerful results, as long as
           certain rules of magic are observed.

           Rituals are typically carried out for:
           � Divination and scrying
           � Communing with fairies, spirits, angels, and demons
           � Blessings and cursing (hexing)
           � Placing or breaking an enchantment upon a place or a person
           � Protection from misfortune or from otherworldly forces
           � Causing harm or accident

           The requirements of a ritual are represented by the inherent negative
           tags requires time, requires concentration, requires gestures or
           incantations, and requires implements. These negative tags do not
           normally come into play when a ritual is performed with adequate
           preparation, but they may limit a witch from taking spontaneous or
           hasteful magical actions (see Cantrips, below).

           Rituals can gain more Power through these means, all of which are
           inherent positive tags:
           � Rhyming (rhyming incantations): This tag is helpful when a player

             (or the Narrator) speaks their witch's incantation with a rhyme. It
             must be a new rhyme each time.

           � Sympathetic Magic (sympathetic magic): This tag is helpful when
             the practitioner has taken considerable effort to symbolically
             represent individuals, forces, or magical laws involved in the ritual.
             This could entail using an effigy or poppet to represent the target
             of the spell, or make a cutting motion with a knife to represent the
             cutting of an emotional bond. If the symbolism is represented by
             an existing tag (such as an item tag), invoke that tag instead.

     � Special Times and Places (time of power, place                      RITUALS WITHIN A SCENE
       of power): These tags are helpful when the ritual                   (Magic Requires Gathering Power)
       is performed during a special time of power,
       such as the new moon or a unique astrological                       When a ritual is carried out within the scene, but

                                                                                lessen the Consequences.
     Narrator: Let's see if you do. We'll resolve this with a Quick roll. What
     tags do you invoke?

     Castor: The one I already said, and also satchel of goodies from my
     backpack. So that's two Power.

     Narrator: I'll add your prone to worrying weakness tag - you were,
     and still are, worried about Kaio and maybe it distracted you from
     snooping around the pub and grabbing supplies. That's one Power less,
     but mark Improve on the theme. And roll!

     Castor: Let's go. Ohh, six on the dice, with one more, that's seven!

     Narrator: Success and Consequences! Sure, you have a torch, and I'll
     even give it as a tag. Add that to your backpack.

     Talis: I don't like it when she's generous...

     Narrator: And the Consequences are that, as I've said, you're indeed
     worried-3. Why did Fahida's caravan turn onto this gods-forsaken
     path to nowhere? Your fear for Kaio, combined with the feeling you've
     come unprepared, begins to get the better of you.

     Castor: Gulp. Can I lessen this?

     Narrator: You can try, yes, with a reaction roll.

     Talis: Can I help? Invoke one of my tags, to aid in the roll?

 Appendices                             Narrator: No, a reaction is an immediate thing. But, after you see him
                                        worried, you can then take action to help reduce that status!

            The Narrator keeps the

                                        holding a sword in each hand. Or do they have swords instead of

           The Narrator announces       From behind it, somewhere inside the cave, you can hear a wailing of
             the action is Imperiled    pain, even louder than the creek's gurgling water. Castor, it hits you
                                        right in the heart!

                                        Castor: I call out, in fear, "Kaio!"

                                        Narrator: The armored figure begins to walk toward you.

                                        Talis: Castor, my cheering up speech will have to wait.

                                        Pepper: I try to see through the darkness, is this a knight of some sort?

                                        Castor: Remember, I'm holding a torch! So it's not that dark.

                                        Narrator: The suit of armor before you is rusted, and you can see
                                        that the swords are indeed directly extending from the arms. There
                                        are no eyes to reflect your lantern light within the helmet. Pepper,
                                        you've still got the spotlight: what do you do?

                                        Pepper: It hasn't raised its swords, yet. Well, I am a pleasant peasant
                                        and I speak straight, and I still have that air-of-confidence-2 I gave
                                        myself for the speech in the pub.

                                        Castor: Too bad we didn't manage to recruit the Broonely twins, we
                                        could use another tag in this fight.

                                        Pepper: There's not going to be a fight! I want to approach this
                                        intimidating figure and say, "You, what are those cries behind you?
                                        Where is Fahida, and Kaio? Be straight with me!"

                                        Talis: Okay, now I want to help. I am a traveling troubadour, I know
                                        how to draw attention and make this person take us seriously.

                                        Narrator: I'll allow it, but remember, you also share in the
                                        Consequences. Pepper, you're going to need all the help you can get,
                                        because this armor emits a presence unlike you've felt before. It chills
                                        you to the bones.

                                        Castor: Is that a status?

                                        Narrator: Worse, it has a Mighty presence, at Adventure level, making
                                        your action Imperiled. There is no person inside that suit of armor, yet
                                        you can feel an otherworldly essence, the likes of which you've never
                                        faced before. Farmhouse firmness may not avail you here. In addition, it
                                        is resolute-2, it is clear from its body language.

                                        Pepper: I still want to try.

                                                                           A ppendices  --                         235

     it. Pepper, fear grips you, unnatural and undeniable, and you take
     cowed-1, which is increased by 3 whole tiers because you are
     Imperlied! So we'll make it terrified-4.

     Pepper: Ahh! I still have an air-of-confidence-2, can I use that to
     lessen this?

     Narrator: Afraid not, because you already invoked it in the action
     itself. No double dipping. But since it's a polar status � you usually
     can't be both afraid and confident � then you'll lose two tiers of air-
     of-confidence and take only afraid-2 instead of terrified-4.

     Talis: Wait! It was Pepper's action, but I helped, so maybe I can sing
     something cheerful?...

     Narrator: You can, but as an action. A reaction must be immediate.
     The wailing returns, and the armor seems to recollect itself. Talis, do
     you try to alleviate Pepper of the gripping fear?

     Talis: You know what, there'll be time for that later if I can handle this
     foul spirit. It reminds me of the haunting devil we banished once, so I
     hope this creature too has a banish Limit.

     Narrator: Let's do this Detailed. Tell me what Talis does.

     Talis: I take a step forward and shout as a traveling troubadour
     who knows the lore of yore, calling out "By the old oaths, spirit, I
     command you! Return to the wretched realms!" I'll even burn the lore
     tag for Power! This is all of the lore I remember right now, apparently.

     Castor: Begone, entity! Castor jumps up and down.

     Narrator: Your Adventure theme is relevant, and matches against the
     armor's Might aspect, so you are not Imperiled.

     Talis: Ah. Well. Anyway, I got double ones.

     Pepper: Buhh!

     Narrator: The gorge echoes for a moment with your powerful words,
     Talis, but this armor is bound by no oaths. Before you finish speaking,
     its sword is at your throat...

                        INTRODUCTION

       Narrator, Begin Here

       Every Legend in the Mist game has a Narrator, whether
                     you play solo, in a pair, or with a group. The Narrator
                     is the organizing voice of your story, the one who
                     gives it structure, introduces challenges and surprising
       twists, and who upholds the ancient storytelling rule that every
       action and every choice has consequences.

        In the classic group roleplaying format, one participant takes the role
        of the Narrator, while other players each take the role of one of the main
        protagonists, the Heroes. In such a game group, the Narrator is also often
        the host of the game (or Master of Ceremonies) who helps manage the
        conversation. In a solo game, you play both the Hero and the Narrator, and in
        a co-op game, the role of the Narrator is distributed between all players, who
        also play as Heroes.

        This volume will guide you through Narrating your games. The advice and
        tools given here are adapted to all styles of play.

       long, you're starting a new story. Here are                         interpersonal? Perhaps a combination of all of the

them to undertake it? Where will it take place? What Challenges will
they face? An adventure is a collection of details that will inform your
creation of scenes as you play: stakes, locations, and Challenges
(explained below).

There are many ways to come by the details of an adventure:
� You can improvise them as you go along (no prep needed).

� You can use the Oracle to generate them for you as you go along (no
  prep needed).

� You can use premade published adventures that already include all the
  details, such as The Heap-Thing Of Skunk Glen in this book (page 208)
  or the ones included in the Hearts of Ravensdale Setting Book.

� You can prepare your own by collecting all the elements needed in advance
  as explained in Designing Adventures and Series (page 44).

STAKES
The Heroes need a reason to go on a journey of change, whether it is a
personal one or a grand quest (even though this reason is not always
immediately evident). If you are planning a series of adventures, think
of the series stakes � what great danger or hope is calling the Heroes
to embark. It could be a dark tyrant, a strange plague, or a legend of a
magical sword.

For each adventure, choose adventure stakes on a smaller scale,
something that could be resolved within the scope of a few sessions: a
neighbor in need of help, a monster prowling the region, or a banquet
where a Hero could be knighted.

The stakes should always be connected to the Heroes' personal
Quests, to the Fellowship Quest, or to their other goals. Read more on
this under Designing Adventures and Series (page 44).

LOCATIONS
Locations are where the scenes of your adventure take place. What are
the interesting or dangerous places that will feature in your story? It's
useful to envision these places in your mind and to jot some details about
each. You could use images or maps to visualize each location for yourself
or the other participants, such as the maps in the Legend in the Mist Maps
& Tokens Pack.

CHALLENGES
To win the stakes, the Heroes must overcome Challenges, whether
external or within themselves. Anything can be a Challenge in a story,
from a toxic relative to a devouring monster, from a dark forest that
must be traversed to a tome of secrets that must be deciphered. The
rules for using Challenges and for creating your own are explained in
The Satchel of Perils (page 102), which also contains a variety of
ready-to-use Challenges.

    PLAYING A SESSION

    Whenever you sit down to tell the story of your Heroes, that's

    a session. During a session, the Narrator has several roles.

    The DIRECTOR of the story. They control the pacing, mood, and
    unfolding of the story with their choices:
    � Which scene will come next, based on the Heroes' choices.
    � What developments will unfold during a scene.
    � Which Hero will get the spotlight next, ensuring everyone gets their turn.
    � Whether to resolve a Hero's action with a Simple, Quick, or Detailed

      outcome.
    � What the Consequences of actions will be, and whether a Hero can

      react to them.

    The STORYTELLER who sets each scene and portrays all non-Hero
    characters and forces. They describe the situation, and the people and
    items around. They choose how non-player characters behave and react,
    what they say, and what they think or feel.

    The REFEREE of the game. They decide which tags to introduce and
    when they expire, and make rulings about player actions, such as what
    can and cannot be done in a scene, which tags are helpful or hindering,
    and which tags are direct, indirect, or irrelevant.

    The HOST of the game. They manage the conversation around the table,
    keep the game flowing, set the atmosphere in the room with music and
    lighting, and call break time.

    The roles and considerations of a Narrator during a session are explained
    in depth under Narrating A Session (page 16).

How to Make Choices When Narrating                                         CNoanrsriadteirvaetions

Being the Narrator involves a lot of choices and decision making. It is    CsfoayctfNsTHmwortoonrhohouearooluenooradmermyarwttskkneyortathiscnstusaiidbenvn,ieeroterosoi"lwmrotlmifsobwtoeoyratkherownfh.aotsi"ivs�i-nncaiNrsI,bi.ometygtnoocnDavstisauoroora,ysrarnmtklioa"sraaugai,utrasinnmswnhwceeattkugfdtsieoinleatnvo,ltraneosidennahnTcylsthodtoterhViweaesramueleglle"rllllr,bye.riganeioalutgsurptpd!s
a form of art; there are many ways to do it, and different Narrators and
players prefer different Narration styles. When making choices during a
session, a Narrator can draw on many different sources:
� Use prepared resources

  � Go by the rules of the game (especially in their role as a Referee)
  � Use prepared adventure details (stakes, locations, Challenges)
  � Draw from the Heroes, their themes, tags, and Quests

� Choose based on narrative considerations
  � Go by what makes sense
  � Go by what is consistent with the story so far
  � Go by what's cool in the moment
  � Go by what would make for better storytelling (pacing, surprise,
    drama, etc.)
  � Improvise and follow your creative flair

� Use your social skills
  � Go by what is fair
  � Read the room, sense the needs of the group and of individual
    players

� Delegate the decision
  � Ask the Oracle (page 238)
  � Ask the group

LOOK AT YOUR PLAYERS
While your own enjoyment of the game as a Narrator is essential,
you're also facilitating the game for the other players, who are an
active audience and fellow storytellers.

Check in with the players by reading their expressions and body
language and listening to them. It can tell you a lot about how
engaged they are and whether the story is currently capturing their
imagination. It's impossible to make everyone happy all the time
(and oftentimes, a player can be unengaged for reasons unrelated to
you as the Narrator or the story), but reading your audience is a good
performative skill for a Narrator to cultivate.

LET THE NARRATIVE SURPRISE YOU
Even though as the Narrator you have great power, you do not have
full control over the narrative, and that's how it should be. The best
roleplaying moments happen when you let go of how you think the
story will unfold. Stay open to having the Heroes' actions surprise you,
and know that whenever you let the dice have a say � with a Quick or
Detailed outcome, or when consulting the Oracle � they are sure to
surprise you as well.

You can also have events develop in unexpected ways by simply
asking the players questions about their Heroes or their world, and
then using their answers as a springboard.

Remember, you play to find out what happens next!

        Narrating A Session

        The following guide walks you through everything
                      you need to know and consider when running the
                      game, whether you are the Narrator for a group or for

ADVENTURE,
SESSION, SCENE

In each session, you will play through one or more scenes of your
adventure, however many you can fit in the time you have.

Whenever one scene ends, you choose where the next one will take place.

The Sequence Of Scenes
Is Not Predefined

While, as the Narrator, you may have prepared some scenes with locations and
Challenges, you never truly know how the story will develop and what the next
scene will be. The Heroes can make unexpected choices or the dice could surprise
you with sudden twists of fate, prompting scenes you did not plan.

Whenever a scene ends, the Narrator chooses the next scene
according to the following logic:

Expected Scenes � Where the Heroes go next
� If the Heroes go to a nearby location within a short spell of time, a

  new scene can start there.

� If the Heroes travel further afield, play a Journey montage or skip
  the journey and have them arrive at the next scene a while later
  ("cut" to a later time and place).

� If the Heroes decide to camp or sojourn somewhere, play through
  that montage.

Unexpected Scenes � What happens before the Heroes arrive at
the next expected scene
� If someone seeks out or ambushes the Heroes, a new scene can

  start when and where the Heroes first become aware of it.

� If an important event happens close to the Heroes while they are in
  between scenes and they choose to engage with it, a new scene can
  start then and there.

Ask the Oracle
� If you can't think of the next logical scene, ask the Conflict Oracle

  (page 246).

                           game loop on Vol. I, page 146). In each scene, the Heroes take turns acting, and
                           each turn plays through these three steps: (Re)Establish, Action, Consequences.

                          You present the scene, describing:
                          � Where the Heroes are and what is happening around them,

                       � What the stakes are (why the Heroes are there and why it matters),
                       � What the Challenges are (anything in the Heroes' way to their goals),
                       � What Threats are posed to the Heroes or their goals, if any.

                          You then ask "What do you do?" and give one Hero the spotlight, so
                          everyone is now listening to them.

        ACTION
        When a Hero is in the spotlight, they describe what they do in the scene,
        responding to all that has been Established.
        You may choose one of three ways to determine the outcome of the action:
        rule what happened or give them further details about the scene (Simple),
        ask the Hero to roll the dice (Quick), or ask them to roll the dice and, if they
        succeed, spend their Power on Effects according to their action (Detailed).

                           CONSEQUENCES
                          You deliver negative Consequences for the Hero's action if any of the
                          following happened:
                          � they ignored a Threat,
                          � their roll generated Consequences
                          � you choose to invoke their weakness tags for Consequences.
                          You may add Effects.

                            You may also allow them (or any Hero affected)
                            to lessen these Effects by making a reaction roll.

ESTABLISHING A SCENE

Whenever you Establish or re-Establish a scene,                               NCSutaelrtpriavBtayotreStSYekopiullrs
follow these steps:
                                                                              TtdcNdhoiohvaneneirmss'triingdaahuettlariolodavraetet'tshittoeoaronnokmslmeceaseo,a.nfabsyuttdhetereyeopu

� Create story tags as needed
� Highlight the stakes, to keep the players focused
� Introduce Challenges
� Make Threats
� (Optionally, present a Dilemma)
� Give the spotlight

When you first Establish a scene, you describe it in greater detail.

You re-Establish after every Hero action, when its Consequences are
resolved. While many things in the scene are likely to remain the same,
use this opportunity to consider if anything new is happening.

 ? How did the environment and the NPCs in the scene respond to the
   last Hero action and the last Consequences?

 ? Have the stakes shifted? Are the Heroes closer to winning or losing
   the stakes?

 ? Should new Challenges appear at this point?

 ? What are the next Threats posed by the Challenges in the scene?

EXPIRE SHORT-LIVED TAGS
This is a good time to expire any story tags or statuses from previous
turns whose time has passed (for example, a Hero who was prone had
time to get up).

Painting A Picture

Just as when telling a fireside tale, your words, tone, body language, and
even silences are all channels through which the players learn about the
world of their Heroes.

DESCRIBE THE PLACE AND TIME
Start with the basics: What is the ground like? Are there walls or
vegetation? What's above or below the Heroes? Where is light coming
from, what sounds can be heard, what smells are prominent? What is the
weather like? Is it humid? Raining? Show the time of day not only by the
sun's position, but also with who or what is around and what activities they
are taking, as well as the Heroes' sensations like hunger and tiredness.

                                                                                  SCENE TAGS
If something you Establish seems likely to have an effect on the scene,
consider adding it as a story tag. As the Narrator, you can always add                  WEATHER
story tags and statuses to the scene, but the best time to do so is during
the Establish phase (giving negative story tags or statuses directly to a               high winds
Hero should be done only as Consequences). You can use the story tag                       rain
column of the Conflict Oracle (page 246) to help you come up with tags
for your scene.                                                                      sweltering heat
                                                                                            fog
Story tags can highlight the weather, terrain, ambiance, hazards, objects,
environmental factors, and even individuals and groups in the scene.                     TERRAIN
Statuses can represent the transient but impactful conditions in the scene
such as foggy-3 or warded-against-demons-3.                                          uneven ground
                                                                                          thicket
A negative tag would make certain actions harder for the Heroes (by                        mud
reducing their Power), while a positive one will make certain actions
easier (by increasing it). Some tags can be both, such as gale winds that            spike barricades
affect both Hero and enemy archers.
                                                                                        A M B I A NC E
When adding tags, remember:
                                                                                 mournful atmosphere
� Adding a story tag to the scene is like saying to the players "This is           fragrant spring air
  important" or "This has the potential to have an impact on our story."              tense moment
                                                                                  boring conversation
� A scene doesn't need more than a few tags, if any. Heroes and
  Challenges already have their own tags and ways to add more, so only                   HAZARDS
  add a tag if you want the Heroes to interact with it.
                                                                                    crackling bonfire
� Tags only influence Hero actions and reactions � they don't actively                   oil patch
  harm the Heroes. If you want an element in the scene that actively
  delivers Consequences, make it a Challenge, then give it the tags you             poisonous fumes
  planned on adding. If you want a hazard that could seriously harm a               thorny brambles
  character, like an abyss or a river of lava, it's enough to describe it as
  such � it does not need a tag.                                                          OBJECTS

Highlighting The Stakes                                                                   lantern
                                                                                           rake
Keep the Heroes focused on what matters to them in this scene. If you're
not sure, you can ask them. Stay open to a Hero choosing to pursue other               barrel of fish
stakes, and keep those in mind.                                                       warm beef pie

them what must be done to achieve this, to the best of their Heroes'                      FAC T OR S
knowledge. This should be an action that is available here and now,
one step in a long line of steps to achieve the ultimate goal of the series.           waning light
When Establishing, repeat the stakes so everyone knows what the scene                loud explosions
is about, why you're playing it.
                                                                                         bar fight
Tie the stakes to the Heroes' Quests or short-term goals. Perhaps a Hero                 too quiet
needs to drive off a monster in order to protect their tribe (their Devotion
Quest) or in order to make some money to buy passage on the ferry from               I N DI V I DUALS
South Crossing. If they lose track of why they are here, remind them.

Notice when the stakes shift. If the original goal is subverted � for example,    silent washerwoman
an interrogation is interrupted when the room is suddenly flooded � the scene
stakes are replaced with a new set of stakes, so re-Establish them.                  watchful raven

Do you anticipate that this Challenge will be easy or difficult
for the Heroes to overcome? What sacrifices will they have to
make? Consider how many Challenges are already present
and how well the Heroes are handling them so far. Do you
want to increase the pressure, or relieve it?

See also Adjusting The Difficulty (page 41).

 ? How much of the session time and attention do I want
   this Challenge to occupy? Therefore, should it be
   resolved in short form or long form?

Short form: Resolving a Challenge with a Simple or Quick
action means it will occupy a short story beat, possibly
delivering Consequences once (which may still be impactful),
and then the story will move on.

Long form: Resolving a Challenge with a Limit whose
overcoming requires Detailed actions (giving statuses)
means you're going for a play-by-play conflict. It may take
multiple actions to overcome.

Usually, a scene contains at least one long form
(Limit) Challenge, such as a monster to fight, an
NPC to convince, or a ritual to conduct or stop, OR
a set of short form Challenges such as a locked
door, a trap, and a high window to escape
through.

Don't overdo it. One or two Challenges
at a time are more than enough. You
can always introduce a new Challenge,
either when re-Establishing the scene
or as a Consequence. Also remember
that many difficulties don't need to be
reflected as a new Challenge � they
can be story tags in the environment or
added to an existing Challenge.

Normally, all Consequences dealt by a Challenge must begin with a
Threat. Even a hidden trap or a stealthy wolf should issue a Threat to         paaGrtoNtptoheefhrrnearceeneedetorsiaehsrcmmrelrecehenaoaHmshaattmpslvoeellilpyleornoeare,lnnnoanydtti'eet,hseytgorsd'eeaesdQsrdttwi.frrtlu.eotehhymeImorsseettottmnftosrisihnastoe,dle
allow the players to respond by taking action.

However, sometimes making an explicit Threat ruins the surprise, or doesn't
quite make sense because the Hero may not yet be able to perceive the
Challenge (Unseen Dangers, page 24). Other times you want to reward
the Heroes' alertness, rather than feed them the Threat with a silver spoon.

In such cases, you can make Threats that are intentionally vague,
trying to mask the Threat's true nature or even that it is a Threat. You
can make such Threats as part of your Establishing, possibly even a long
while before delivering the Consequence, making them harder to detect.
Providing conflicting or curious descriptions can pull at the players'
interest, and push them into taking action to find out more.

� There are legends of treasure in this place, and yet
  no one has ever returned from here. (trap)

� She gives you a wide smile, and yet her eyes narrow. (betrayal)
� Even though the sun has just set, you hear the hooting of

  the Rustwood Owls echoing all around you. (ambush)

An alert Hero may follow up by taking action to check for traps or discern
someone's true intentions, earning their chance to stop the Consequence. If
they failed to pay attention, then later, when you deliver the Consequences,
the Heroes can reflect on the signs that they missed and learn for next time.

Presenting Dilemmas

A part of your role as the Narrator is to put hard choices in the path of
the Heroes. When you Establish, you can narrate a situation that poses a
dilemma for one or more of the Heroes. An effective dilemma is a choice
between two or more things the Hero wants, or two or more things the Hero
doesn't want, and it should in most cases involve one of the Hero's Quests:
� Choosing between two Quests (such as helping their Devotion against

  learning from a master to improve their Skill or Trade)

� Choosing between a Quest and a short-term goal (such as reaching the last
  Milestone of their Magic theme against saving an innocent life)

Try to present a situation that creates a conflict and forces a choice. For
example, you can pose a Threat to their Companion at the same time as
you pose a Threat to their village. Which will they choose?

Another way to present a dilemma is to Force The Hero To Choose
between Consequences (page 33) during the Consequence phase.

Giving the Spotlight

The Establish phase ends when you ask the Heroes as a group or a
specific Hero "What do you do?". This signals the Hero to consider the
stakes, the Challenges, the Threats made, and the dilemmas, and choose
their next action (Managing The Spotlight, Vol. I, page 148).

    Once you have chosen the Hero who will receive the
    spotlight and act this turn, the focus turns over to them
    and the Hero Action phase of the game loop begins.
    Your role as the Narrator during this phase is to act as
    the referee and help adjudicate what is possible or not,
    which tags apply and in what way, and more.

    Listen To The Action's Description

    Make sure you understand what the Hero wants to do and how
    it relates to the scene. Ask clarifying questions if needed. Tell the
    player if you think the action is impossible or doesn't make sense
    based on the scene and the setting, or if it is outside the scope of
    the scene (page 18) and discuss together how to revise it.

    The description of an action matters. Later, it will define what
    tags are relevant and what outcomes this action could have.

    Choose How To Reach The Outcome

    Put on your storyteller hat. Think of the scene, the
    session so far, and the pacing at which the story is
    moving. Ask yourself:

     ? How much should our story delve into this specific action?

    If the answer is "not too much", which means you prefer brevity, try
    a Simple or Quick outcome. If you want to get into the details, use a
    Detailed outcome. You can learn more about these outcomes under
    Taking Action (Vol. I, page 149).

    SIMPLE OUTCOME (NO ROLL)
    For actions exploring the scene that are not yet dramatic, such
    as casual perceiving, moving, or speaking. Normally, you can let
    the player keep the spotlight until they reach a dramatic action
    that has a Success, Consequence, or both.

    When the outcome is certain or obvious. If there is no resistance
    to the action, it just happens. If it's impossible, it doesn't. If it's
    doomed to fail, it fails with Consequences. If it works but the price
    is set, then it Succeeds and the price is the Consequences.

    When the outcome is not dramatic enough to merit more of the
    session's time. You could zoom in on it and make the Hero roll, but
    it's not what's important or interesting right now.

    When you don't want to leave it for the dice. Maybe the Hero
    labored hard to get to this point and now you just let them have
    their moment.

For uncertain and dramatic actions to which you want to dedicate

getting into unnecessary details.

DETAILED (ROLL & SPEND)
Whenever the Hero is attempting to max a Challenge's Limit in
order to overcome it. They do so by spending their Power to give that
Challenge an appropriate status, and so their action must be Detailed.

For actions whose outcome you want to measure or quantify with
game elements. How much has the Hero heard while eavesdropping?
Have them spend their Power on the discover Effect. How great is
the impact of their words? Have them spend it on a convince status.
How well did they heal their ally? Have them spend it on removing a
hacking cough tag.

When you want to let the Hero define their own Success.
Sometimes the player wants their action to have specific Effects, such
as summoning a creature with certain story tags.

Arriving at a Simple Outcome:
Making A Judgement Call

Consider the situation, the Hero's relevant tags and Might (Vol.
I, page 171), the tags and Might of the target of the action, the
environment, and any support the Hero may have.

Choose whether the action Succeeds. If so, decide how this
success changed the narrative, what new information is revealed,
and whether to embody this in a tag or status (or by removing a tag
or status).

Choose whether the action has Consequences. If so, decide what
they are in the Consequence phase (page 33).

Arriving at a Quick Outcome:
Supporting A Player's Roll

With a Quick outcome, the player begins by invoking their tags
(including statuses), helping and hindering, to count the action's
Power (Counting Power, Vol. I, page 152).

Consider the description of the action and, based on that:

� Consider Might by comparing the Might required for the attempted
  action with the Hero's Mighty themes (or lack thereof). If the Hero
  is severely outclassed or punching above their weight, they may be
  Imperiled (-3 Power) or Extremely Imperiled (-6 Power). If their
  ability greatly exceeds what is needed for the task, they may be
  Favored (+3 Power) or Extremely Favored (+6 Power).

DELIVERING
CONSEQUENCES

After the Hero's action for this turn has been resolved, it is               Ea(IbyCtsMoaotnyxoHuaugcti6t'ntsrrdeguereossfhsdmaofoteestraetwtleqiliythyveahutuereoIhsrisHermeitneosndiprCroeeeIocrropr1msmnewitlsphtseoaheader)loqlr.gyu3aiilesfebnondydrc3es

                                                                             atFFttRsbahhtaayeHageivvds3tooeufCurrrscososeeoierttnddatuwC.asia(teehoToutHrqnohvsisuoeseieinrtesrosniqow)reccEurhwoae3esxusennht.lltocdmdroareeignbismns1syugelfll6iyionfry
� The Hero ignored a Threat
� The Hero's action generated Consequences
� You choose to invoke one of the Hero's weakness tags as a

   source of Consequences

If none of these apply, skip the Consequences phase.

There is no limit to how many Consequences you may deliver, or how
severe. Use them to challenge the Heroes, but keep in mind your narrative
considerations (How to Make Choices When Narrating, page 11).

The Consequences may be purely narrative, altering the story and
introducing new twists:
� Blocked: A course of action is no longer possible

� Complication: The Hero is placed in an uncertain, undesirable, or
  awkward position

� Exposure: Something the Heroes don't want known is revealed

� Ill Tidings: Something bad happens around the Heroes (but not to
  them) evoking shock, rage, or sadness

� New Challenge: A new problem enters the scene

� Yes, but...: You place a limit or constraint on a Successful action

Or, they may also include negative Effects (tags and statues). You may
give or remove any number of tags or status tiers, depending on how
impactful you want this Consequence to be (Adjusting The Difficulty,
page 41).
� Give the Hero a negative status or tag
� Remove a positive status or tag from the Hero
� Give a Challenge a positive status or tag
� Remove a negative status or tag from a Challenge
� Advance or set back a status tracking a process (Progress Limits, Vol. I,

  page 169)

You can also Force The Hero To Choose between Consequences, such as
either losing their sword or losing their ally.

You may allow the Hero to react and lessen the Consequences, if it
makes sense.

Consequences are marked with a skull ( ).

Consequences that come from Challenges.

INVOKING A WEAKNESS TAG FOR CONSEQUENCES

During the Consequences phase, a Hero's weakness tags can be invoked
to deliver Consequences on an otherwise Consequence-free action, or
to add more Consequences that are related to it. The Hero then marks
Improve on the tag's theme (or the Fellowship theme, if it is a Fellowship
weakness tag). Negative story tags cannot be invoked in this way.

The invoked weakness tag must fit the situation and explain why
the action has run afoul. It cannot be a tag that was already invoked
in the action, and, if invoked, it cannot be invoked again during the
following reaction.

For example, a ne'er-do-well scoundrel Hero with the weakness tag
  known in Soddenmore steps into a Soddenmore tavern to inquire

about a nearby ruin. While this Simple action Succeeds without
Consequences, the Narrator invokes this tag to deliver Consequences,
saying a few people recognize the Hero and gather around, cracking
knuckles, ready to teach him a lesson. The Hero marks Improve on
the tag's theme, and prepares for a brawl.

that line, I cannot help you."                                             beats its last beat.

Reactions

Whenever you deliver a Consequence that includes Effects, whether
it is the Hero's turn or not, you can choose to allow the Hero to react
and lessen the Consequences. Ask yourself:

 ? Can the Hero defend themself from this?

If so, allow them a reaction.

Supporting a Hero's reaction roll is similar to Arriving At a Detailed
Outcome (page 32).

A reaction should not be used to prevent narrative Consequences (in the
same way Consequences cannot undo a Success); to avoid an unwanted
situation, the Hero must respond to it when a Threat is first made.

        Designing Adventures
             And Series

        There are many ways to come by the details of your
                   Heroes' adventure (Setting Up A Game, page 8),
                      including using published adventures or completely
                      improvising them as you play. However, if you're a

        storyteller at heart, you may want to prepare your very own
        adventure or even an entire series, and craft the story your
        Fellowship will play through.

         Some thoughtful preparation goes a long way, and can help you tell a more
         coherent and impactful story during play. This section walks you through
         designing your own adventures and series.

that form a longer story, similar to one or more books or TV series
seasons, usually revolving around one or several major Series
Challenges. A series, especially if it is long, can be broken into acts
or arcs of more closely-related adventures.

THE MOUNTAIN (PAGE 54)

The Mountain is a series model that revolves around a central Series
Challenge, a terrible danger or villain such as a cursed blight or
a dark overlord or, conversely, a lofty goal, such as obtaining the
Peaches of Immortality or leading your people to a new home in a
safe and fertile land.

With this model, the series is an epic journey with a clear destination
that increases in difficulty as the Heroes approach the end until �
after many trials, tribulations, distractions, and detours � they find a
path to overcome the Series Challenge.

THE CROSSROADS (PAGE 72)

The Crossroads is a series model where the Heroes juggle multiple
incoming threats that change and evolve throughout the series.
Each of these major Series Challenges is called a Front, and each
progresses towards a specific endgame that the Heroes must prevent,
alter, or adapt to.

With this model, the emphasis is placed on the dynamic and
changeable world in which the Heroes live. There is often no singular
clear goal, but a collection of short- and long-term goals that the
Heroes define for themselves as the story progresses.

Out of the frames of play presented in the Introduction

rotating dangers and drama, or Grit & Politics, where there is
no one defined enemy or morality, but rather a game of survival.

Choose which scenes come first and which
come later, and which scene leads to which,
and make sure there are threads connecting
between them. This way you create order and
structure in your adventure.

Review your chart of scenes and threads and make
sure there is at least one path from the Hooks,
where the adventure begins, to the scene where the
Adventure Challenge can be overcome. And what
if the Heroes miss a clue, item, or opportunity?
You can have the same vital thread pop up in the
next scene, or create alternate paths through the
adventure. The Heroes may carve their own path
when you play, but your threads should provide
ample opportunities for them to move forward.

You may also want to sprinkle in additional
clues and world lore that will help the Heroes
understand more about the Adventure Challenge
and how it can be overcome, or about the situation
at hand and the NPCs involved.

    Example Adventure Design: A Feast To Devour

    Narrator Reya is working on a new adventure.                           Reya now begins to sketch out the scenes:
    It is set in the rustic fantasy world of Hearts of
    Ravensdale, but the Fellowship are a group of                          � A welcoming scene at the courtyard, where the
    itinerant sellswords out in the wilderness known                         guests are first presented
    as the Wanderlands, passing from village to farm
    in search of work and Creatures of Twilight to slay.                   � An Occasion Journey that is used to fast forward
    It's all Grit & Politics, rather than an epic tale.                      some time during the 3-day feast

    Maghorn (Charge), a merchant attending a
    three-day feast at a local warlord's manse, who                        � A heist scene, where the Heroes try to break into
    hires the Fellowship to protect him. Maghorn is                          the strixa's room unnoticed, perhaps at the same
    convinced he has been marked with a dark curse                           time as others attend the social event
    by one of the feast guests and that they mean
    to lure him to his doom there. To protect him,                         � A battle scene, where the strixa breaks Adain's

    Reya now turns to flesh out the background for                           uses this distraction to complete his ritual
    her adventure. In a region so lawless and sparsely-                      against Maghorn
    populated as the Wanderlands, Maghorn is a
    surprisingly thriving merchant who has become a                        � A personal Quest scene, where one of the
    favorite of the hostess, Shiyon, a woman of some                         honored guests has word about one of the Hero's
    military means. Many among the guests covet his                          long-lost brother (a Quest) but wants a good
    fortune and connections, not least of which is Adain                     price for it
    Foxheart, a village priest who is also a trader, and
    secretly, a witch. He has a spell that could siphon                    Reya puts the scenes in a sketch, as seen on the
    Maghorn's wealth but he needs to have access to                        next page, and begins to populate each of them
    Maghorn to complete it. He has also summoned                           with details: Scene Stakes, location and time,
    a strixa � a vampiric, shapeshifting Creature of                       Challenges, NPCs, and rewards. She creates some
    Twilight � to serve as an ally and a distraction, but                  Challenge Profiles for the top Challenges.
    the priest's hold over her is fragile at best. She attends
    the feast impersonating another guest, Sinica of                       Then, she connects the scenes with threads, so
    Stormhelm, whom the strixa killed. Narrator Reya                       that there are at least a few clear paths through the
    thinks she needs a few more guests to mask the                         adventure. Her adventure is shaping up to have a
    true culprit, so she drafts a handful of other peculiar                clear beginning, middle, and end, a classic three-
    NPCs with whom to populate the feast.                                  act structure.

    The Adventure Stakes are whether or not the                            As a last step, Reya considers how the Heroes
    Heroes can protect Maghorn through the feast.                          could emerge from this adventure, its Aftermath.
    Their reputation, and indeed their payment, are at                     If they save Maghorn, their purse will certainly be
    stake. The Hook is simple enough for this group of                     heavier. Impressing or upsetting Shiyon could see
    sellswords: a contract, offered by Maghorn himself                     them embroiled with her, one way or another. And
    at the inn where the Fellowship often stops to                         if Adain Foxheart or the strixa escape, there will be
    refresh themselves from the dusty roads.                               some retribution or a hunt.

                                                                           She dubs her adventure A Feast To Devour. It's ready

    The eternal fantasy story, incarnated in many legends
    from around the world, is an epic tale with humble roots,
    the Hero's Journey.

    It begins when an unknown and unlikely Hero, somewhere faraway
    and removed from trouble, becomes aware of some Great Danger
    that threatens their peace or way of life. Willingly or begrudgingly,
    the Hero embarks on a journey to confront this Great Danger, and
    goes through many trials and tribulations before they are ready
    and able to do so. If they are successful, often at a great cost to
    themselves, peace is restored to their home, and to the world.

    The Mountain is a series planning model that helps you create a
    series that resembles such an epic tale, using the metaphor of a
    mountain � the Heroes begin at the bottom and climb their way
    to the Great Danger at the top. This model helps you define who or
    what the Heroes will be tested against and why, what dangers they
    will be facing, and what reason they have to leave their current lives
    to embark on a journey.

54  --  LEGEND IN THE MIST - VOL . II - THE NARRATOR

CHARTING
THE MOUNTAIN

Begin by drawing a mountain-shaped map or
diagram, representing your series.

The Mountain is divided into three tiers:

� At the Peak lies the Great Danger, the Series Challenge,
  the antagonistic force threatening the safety and peace of
  the Heroes and what they hold dear.

� On the Slopes are the Agents of the Great Danger and
  their domains, powerful forces carrying out the will of
  the Great Danger in different parts and aspects of the
  world.

� In the Lowlands are the Heroes and their familiar world,
  who are threatened by the agents of the remote Great
  Danger. From these humble origins and local incidents,
  often seemingly insignificant in the grand scheme of
  things, the journey begins.

HEROES GROWING IN MIGHT
In a classic Mountain tale, most of the Heroes begin with
mostly Origin themes (with some exceptions welcome).
Through their travels and travails, the Heroes grow in
Might, evolving some themes into the Adventure level.
Eventually, as the series draws to an end, some of them
may even possess world-shaping power as Greatness
themes � and are likewise faced with Greatness-level
Challenges � while others may face great dangers with
naught but their simple Origin.

You may want to outline these possible progression paths
to your Heroes before the series begins. Once the game
starts, let each Hero chart their own path and make their
own choices.

SMALLER SCOPE
The Great Danger does not have to threaten the entire
world. Instead, your series can focus on a smaller part of
the world, or even only the lives of the Heroes and what
belongs to them (family, reputation, riches). The only
condition is that the Heroes care deeply about what they
stand to lose.

In the next step, you flesh out the Agents of the Great Danger, the
bearers of its power and influence in the world. While the Great Danger
is capable, they rarely appear to do the dirty work themselves. Instead,
their Agents are the ones furthering their individual wills and plans. The
Agent, like the Great Danger, might not be a person, creature, or being
but something else � such as an object of power, a spell, or a location.

WHAT MAKES AN AGENT?
An agent has two defining characteristics in terms of series design:

An Agent helps the Great Danger achieve their end goal in a
specific way. The Agent is responsible for enacting one will or one
plan of the Great Danger, usually out of several. The Agent is a force
capable of carrying out this specific will or plan. An Agent's domain
is the region or aspect of the world in which they operate.

For example, the Great Danger is a dark sorcerer whose wish is to
subjugate the kingdom. Their plans and agents could be:

� Conquer the kingdom by force with a bloodthirsty general leading
  an army of the dead

� Weaken the resolve of the king's subjects with a dark curse of fear
� Spread disease throughout the capital through a corrupted grove

  inside the city walls
� Assassinate the king by employing the revived specter of a

  legendary killer

An Agent blocks the Heroes from directly accessing the Great
Danger. The Agents serve as narrative barriers which prevent the
Heroes from just waltzing into an encounter with the Great Danger.
Instead, a portion of the series is dedicated to overcoming the Agents
and opening up the path to the Great Danger.

Some of the ways Agents can block the path to the Great Danger are:

� Deterrence: An Agent can threaten something the Heroes
  hold dear, such as a hostage, in hopes of deterring them from
  confronting the Great Danger.

� Insurmountable power: The Agent grants the Great Danger an ability
  which makes them invincible, like invulnerability, omniscience, or
  mind control. This can be the property of a magical item or a magical
  power granted by the Agent.

� Obfuscation: If the Great Danger is hidden or unknown, an Agent
  could be the one protecting its secrecy, or simply the only one who
  knows them and their location.

� Offensive guardian: The Agent actively hunts down and attacks
  all or certain threats to the Great Danger, making it harder for the
  Heroes to reach, especially once they have been marked as enemies.

� Physical barrier: The Agent physically blocks the Heroes from
  reaching the Great Danger. They could be an impassable fiery
  wasteland, an unbreakable magical shield, or an unbeatable army.

You can draft each Lowland by answering these
questions:

 ? What is this place?

 ? Who calls this place home?

 ? Which Agent's domain does this place belong
   to? It must belong to at least one; places that are
   completely unaffected by an Agent cannot form
   a basis for an adventure in this series.

 ? How is this place threatened by the Agent? If
   the Agent successfully furthers their plan and
   the Great Danger's goal, what will this place's
   doom look like?

 ? Who or what is representing this danger
   locally? Choose the Agent's minion, servant,
   champion, messenger, or lieutenant to be
   the representation of the Great Danger in the
   Heroes' world.

 ? Which of the Heroes' or Fellowship Quests is
   opposed to this doom? The Heroes will likely
   want to stop a threat to their homes, loved ones,
   or ways of life, and yet, their motivations will
   be clearer if there are specific Quests in direct
   opposition to the oncoming danger. As the
   Heroes travel and encounter other Lowland
   locations, these too should be designed to touch
   their personal and group Quests.

    DESIGNING A SERIES

    The Crossroads

    Modern storytelling takes a different approach to                              �YoCdMdteyorahovnuoeunesalcnrsomae,rtppnioamicniaicincgdsnobesobamrarrywibceoFiksgiutnrbinhvaeooidnnnttcthgiheotsere.y�eaourwFerrhoilnet
    fantasy tales. Rather than journeying to overcome a
    single evil, we find our Heroes at the clashing point of
    many conflicting forces.

    Military powers, new religions, sorcerous cults, and strange
    phenomena all rise, grow, and gain prominence � or are foiled � just
    as newer factions emerge. The Heroes are at the center of it all, at the
    Crossroads, choosing how to weather the storm, who to confront and
    who to ally with, fighting to survive in a tumultuous fantasy world.

    A series played with the Crossroads model does not have a single Series
    Challenge or a clear end point. Instead, it is built out of multiple Series
    Challenges called Fronts, which evolve and are resolved individually.
    The Heroes are constantly beset by developments from new and
    existing Fronts, and must juggle between them.

    Such a series does not have adventures, nor Adventure Stakes. It has
    multiple and changing Series Stakes, arising from its Fronts. Each
    session's scenes are picked dynamically as the story unfolds, while
    multiple Fronts compete for the Heroes' time and attention.

    Using Fronts In Your Series

    A Front is a Series Challenge that represents an evolving force
    in the world: a faction, a phenomenon, or an unfolding event. This
    Challenge is of a larger scale than can be resolved in a single scene; it
    is overcome through successfully navigating several and sometimes
    many scenes, and it continues to evolve between scenes, especially
    if left unattended. Fronts develop over multiple sessions, often in
    parallel, and while some are resolved others yet begin.

    The Front's Series Consequence is the ruin or loss that awaits
    the Heroes if they fail utterly in stopping its progression. Such
    Consequences are usually aimed at the Heroes and Fellowship
    Quests, and are added to the Series Stakes.

    FRONT PROGRESSION

    A Front's progression is tracked with a status. Each Front has a
    number of steps � the tiers of its status � that lead to the materializing
    of its Series Consequence. Each tier has its own Progress Threat,
    a warning that the Front is progressing into the next tier, as well as
    Progress Consequences for the implications of the Front achieving
    that tier. A Front progresses in this way, tier by tier, until it reaches its
    Limit, the tier at which its Series Consequences manifest. It could then
    set a new goal, often of greater scope, with a new Limit.

scenes. Alternatively, you can resolve such actions as a Quick outcome
that prevents or sets back one tier; use Might rules (Vol. I, page 178)
to account for the scope of the Front.

Whenever you Establish a scene that presents the Front's next
Progress Threat, the Heroes have a choice: ignore this Front
for now and allow it to progress to the next tier (suffering its
Consequences), or attempt to stop it. Play one or more scenes
around the Heroes' attempt to prevent the Front from progressing; if
they succeed, the Front does not progress to the next tier, for now. If
they fail, the Front progresses, delivers the Consequences of the next
step, and may even gain an unforeseen advantage.

CHOOSING THE NEXT SCENE WITH FRONTS

In a Crossroad game, these types of scenes are common:

� A new Front is established with a scene that has the Front
  showing up in the Hero's world or making the Threat of its first tier.
  The Heroes can respond by learning more or attempting to quell
  this new Front at its inception (if possible).

� An existing Front progresses with a scene involving some of the
  Front's key characters or places moving towards taking the next
  step. Make the Progress Threat for the Front's next tier. The Heroes
  can attempt to stop or mitigate this advancement.

� The Heroes take initiative to foil or set back an existing Front.
  When the players decide on a course of action, play a scene revolving
  around their actions. Success can curtail a Front's progression or set it
  back, or it could even pave the path to permanently overcoming the
  Front. Failure may lead to unexpected progression, possibly even of
  another Front, or any other dramatic outcome.

� The Heroes take action not related to a Front. Such as advancing
  their own goals and Quests, personal or shared, or preparing for future
  trouble. This could come at the cost of allowing a Front to progress.

Often, the same Front takes center stage as the subject of a series of
scenes, with the Heroes' successes and failures in each scene setting
up the next scene with the same Front. Other times, several Fronts
progress at the same time, and each scene within the same session
deals with a Threat from a different Front. In some cases, two fronts
provide Threats simultaneously, forcing the Fellowship to make a
choice: should they address one of them at the expense of the other,
or split up to cover more ground?

Over the course of multiple scenes and often multiple sessions,
Fronts progress and are eventually resolved: either the Heroes
manage to completely address the Front or the Front's Series
Consequences materialize.

    There is in the world a hidden force, the Secret Grace, that
    helps all things come to their place. It is a mystery; its work
    is rarely ever seen. Some call it "fate", others "luck", and
    some ascribe its power to their deities; but in truth, there is
    no one in existence, neither man nor god, who truly knows
    what the Secret Grace is. It comes from someplace far away,
    or entirely unseen, beyond the edges of the world's story,

        It's not working," whispered the young shepherd                    "
                       nervously, staring at the lichen-covered standing
                       stone. His gaze followed the strange, weatherworn
                       lines etched into its face, down to the small altar at
         its base, and the offerings upon it: bunches of dry sage, knitted
         effigies, and many candles which, flickering as they were, seemed
         like the only steady light in the gathering darkness. And in the
         midst of all these, a baby in swaddles, cooing in the cold night air.

         "It must work," the midwife retorted curtly as she was fussing
         over the altar, lighting this and shaking that, leaving a trail of
         sweet smoke through the chill of the night, "that thing that is after
         us won't stop until it has the child. I've seen it before."

         She paused, shuddering momentarily, and then, without looking
         over her shoulder at the grizzled sellsword that was standing
         watch with blade drawn, she added, "Swords won't do here. Not
         unless we force it to take form in this world. Well� not we." and
         she clasped her hands in prayer and lowered her head. "I beseech
         you, Thrice-Named One."

         "Something's coming," the sellsword growled. A squelching sound
         followed, and the sellsword was on her knees, spitting blood.

         "Hurry!", called the shepherd. The midwife drew in a sharp
         breath and let it out slowly, steam curling around her, just as a
         cloud of deeper darkness gathered over her head.

         "Blessed mother, damsel, crone, let us not here stand alone,
         Save this child of Dalish kin, from the bane of Gwyrdolin,
         Let us face our doom athwart, sword to sword, heart to heart,
         Mark the bounds, stay the fright, call this wight unto the light."

         A sudden gust of wind and then silence took over the glade,
         momentarily disturbed by a faraway scream. A figure of shadow
         could scarcely be seen in the light, but there it was, an arm's
         reach from the stone.

         "Now, that�" grunted the sellsword as she rose to her feet
         with a painful groan, tightening her grip on her sword, "that's
         something I can kill."

The Magic Cauldron

Adding special magical rules to your Way of Magic can
          color magical interactions at your table with their own
          unique sparkle.

Imagine a Way of Magic where players must rhyme to cast a
spell, or one where spells are immensely powerful but can only be
used once. Perhaps there is an ancient Law of Creation that only
allows summoners to conjure their own spirit animals, or perhaps
magic drains the land of its life force, making magical battles into a
destructive race for mana that defiles the battlefield forever.

This section offer optional rules for creating richer Ways of Magic for your
game, as well as some recipes and examples you can use to get started.

                                                                           I V - T he M agic Cauldron  --  81

    darkness that ignites ghostly flames in the hollow eye
    sockets of the dead.

    Magic in Legend in the Mist is first and foremost a feeling.
    It is potential and sacrifice, hope and pain, fantastical
    powers and an enchanting sense of mystery.

    When the Heroes encounter magic, it reveals a hitherto unseen
    aspect of the world they live in � and suddenly, all that they thought
    they knew must now be cast in doubt, and burning questions
    arise: What is this magic? Where does it come from? To whom is it
    available, and why? What can it do, and how, and at what cost?

    Magic with no questions, magic that is completely known and
    understood, becomes mundane; but magic that remains a journey of
    discovery can be an evergreen source of wonder for your game.

    Yet in order for magic to be discovered, it needs to be made substantial
    and to have a strongly-felt impact on the story. This impact is
    represented in a system of magical laws, in secret incantations that
    are hard-earned, in a terrible price that must be paid, and in surprising
    side-effects that nevertheless make sense in hindsight.

    Ways of Magic

    The Fundamentals of Magic (Vol. I, page 198) allow you to imagine
    and resolve any magical action, but you can achieve more consistent
    and intriguing results by having a Way of Magic. A Way of Magic is
    the framework through which fantastical powers and abilities come
    to life during gameplay, providing a distinct way to interact with
    the extraordinary. Well-developed Ways of Magic have the power to
    transform your setting into something more alive, engaging, and rich.

    You will find eight fully-cooked and ready-to-play Ways of Magic
    under The Secret of Magic (Vol. I, page 206), which you can drop
    into your game as-is or alter to suit your needs.

    This section walks you through using Ways of Magic as the Narrator
    and brewing your own, allowing you to create deeper and more
    complex magic systems for your game.

Instead of individual Ways of Magic, each defined by its own
Magic theme, you can create Ways of Magic that are defined by an
overarching collection of rules. Such shared rules apply to all magical
actions and Consequences of a specific tradition, style, or source of
magic. All practitioners of the Way and all magical manifestations
emanating from a Way are bound by these same rules.

Like in a theme, these rules are reflected through game elements:
special tags that are used often, such as wand, or common statuses
like mage-vertigo or cursed; special Consequences of using this kind of
magic; and so on.

However, these overarching rules exist outside of themes, as extra rules
that connect and apply to everyone who uses this Way. They cover:

� The limitations, requirements, and side effects of using this Way of
  Magic

� The inherent advantages of this Way of Magic and what could
  make it more or less powerful

� Interesting ways in which this Way of Magic can be used

Using Ways of Magic In Your Game

Ways of Magic come into play even before the game begins.

As the Narrator, decide if the laws of a Way of Magic are known
to the Heroes and what aspects of it they understand. Heroes (and
players) may know the particulars of a Way of Magic, or they may
be in the dark about it. Perhaps practitioners (Heroes or otherwise)
of a Way of Magic know its secrets, and others around them do not,
or perhaps practitioners themselves know very little about the rules
of magic and only discover through trial and error, which could be
surprising and even catastrophic.

Offer the players the possibility of creating a Hero that wields an
available Way of Magic, perhaps by using theme kits to help players
craft appropriate themes. Share the details about a Way of Magic
with those who are in the know, but only what they are aware of.

During the game, simply apply the rules of the Way of Magic
whenever a Hero takes a magical action or reaction, and to
Challenges that use the same Way of Magic.

                                                                           I V - T he M agic Cauldron  --                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      83

        BREWING YOUR
        OWN MAGICAL WAYS

        Begin With A Concept

        As the first step when creating a Way of Magic, take some time
        to consider the following questions and envision its details. This
        concept phase will give your Way of Magic depth and substance, and
        speed up the next steps.

        Origin
         ? What, who, or where is the source or origin of this Way of Magic?
         ? What makes this magic possible, and different from other magic?
         ? Is there a past, ongoing, or future event that allows this magic or
           empowers it?
         ? Who, if anyone, knows about or understands the true source of
           Magic?

        Practitioners or Bearers
         ? Who can use this Way of Magic? What do they believe about it,
           and is it true?
         ? How is it acquired? Is it hereditary, learned, contracted, bestowed
           by someone else?
         ? What is involved in obtaining this magic? Is it difficult or
           dangerous? Is it lengthy or expensive? Is access to this magic
           limited, and if so, by what?
         ? How are those who possess this magic changed by it? What is
           their place in society? What is expected or demanded of them?

        Prevalence
         ? How exclusive or rare is this Way of Magic?
         ? What do lay people know, think, and feel about it? Is it respected,
           feared, ridiculed, or ignored?
         ? What legends and rumors are there about this magic? Are they
           true, false, or misleading?
         ? What creatures, landmarks, places, or events are affected by this
           magic?

        Power
         ? What can this Way of Magic do, and what can't it do?
         ? What types of effects does this Way of Magic excel at and what is
           it weak at?
         ? What is the initial level of power available to a practitioner or
           bearer?
         ? What separates a novice from a master in this Way of Magic, if
           such a distinction even exists? What is needed to grow one's power
           or versatility?

84  --  LEGEND IN THE MIST - VOL . II - THE NARRATOR

 ? What is considered the epitome of this magic, and is it
   available, rare, or beyond reach?

 ? How is magical power or knowledge obtained, stored, or
   transferred?

Price and Restrictions
 ? What or who, if anything or anyone, prevents this magic from
   changing society or tearing the world apart?
 ? What price must practitioners or bearers of this magic pay for
   using it, or for simply having it?
 ? What restrictions, requirements, or taboos limit the use of this
   magic, and why?

Pick Out Ingredients

All shared Ways of Magic build upon the Fundamentals of Magic
(Vol. I, page 198), the regular use of the game rules, by adding
special rules that apply to all magic actions and reactions of the
Way.

Base Ingredients (page 86) are a Way's essential building
blocks. They are rules that apply to one of the game elements
� tags, statuses, Consequences, etc. For example, all magic
actions could inflict the status fatigued on the practitioner as a
Consequence.

Compound ingredients (page 89) combine several base
ingredients to emulate common tropes about magic, such as Magic
Carries a Price or Magic Is Spent When Used. You may find it
easier to build your Way out of compound ingredients, but you may
also find you want to tweak them to your liking.

You can combine as many or as few ingredients as you wish in
your Way of Magic. However, the more rules you add, the more
bookkeeping will usually be required in play, which can take away
from the immersiveness of using magic.

As a starting point for your exploration, check out the Ideas For
More Ways Of Magic (page 94), which make some suggestions
about how to approach common types of magic seen in fiction, but
still require some work to become fully-baked Ways of Magic.

Optional: Write Up Specific Actions

You can use Rotes (page 98) to explain magic actions that are
especially complex or structured, or that are unique to your Way of
Magic.

Inherent tags are story tags that describe the Way of Magic and
automatically apply to all magic actions taken with that Way of
Magic. They cannot be removed without changing the nature of
magic itself (perhaps through a Moment of Fulfillment, Vol. I, page
193). Heroes should not take these as power or weakness tags, but
they may take tags to offset them.

Positive inherent tags present an opportunity for Heroes to gain more
Power for their actions in certain conditions. Magic Ways that are
inherently better when rhyming spells gain +1 Power when a spell
rhymes; lycanthropy can be stronger by moonlight.

Negative inherent tags are a requirement for Heroes which, if not
fulfilled, will cost them Power, such as requires time, requires
hand gestures, requires incantations, or requires ingredients.
Or, they can be specific conditions which weaken all magic of this
Way, such as weaker by daylight.

Statuses & Limits

Typical statuses often come in to play when using a given Way of
Magic, whether as preparation for a magic action (gathering-qi in a
martial arts Way), as products of a magic action (hexed in a witchcraft
Way), given to magical entities (banished for summoned creatures),
or as Consequences (pyromancer's uncontrolled-blaze or a demon
summoner's tenuous-control).

Required statuses must be possessed by a Hero in order to use a
magic action. For example, a sorcery Way of Magic may require
mana to cast spells; if the Hero has no mana status, they are without
magic. These statuses may affect the magic action, but usually they
only measure an important amount such as mana, above, or progress
toward completion of a ritual.

Inherent statuses are tracked for all magic users of a Way of Magic.
A Way of divine power may have a divine-favor or divine-disapproval
polar status that is alway at play, although it may be at times have a
tier of 0, and therefore have no impact.

Typical or inherent Limits are Limits that often come into play
or are always tracked, respectively. When such a Limit is maxed,
it triggers an event (e.g. the ritual is complete) or the magic user is
overcome by it. For example, an elemental Way of Magic could
track the level of a given element in an elementalist's body, with
enflame (Fire), calcify (Earth), liquify (Water), etc. Once
the Limit is maxed, the elementalist momentarily becomes a
being of pure element, for better or for worse; if it is exceeded, the
transformation is permanent.

          Chapter V

 The Satchel
 of Perils

              Challenges

         There are many perils in the world, and the Heroes of
                       the story come across all manners of obstacles and
                       adversaries on their journey. Some can harm one's
                       body, but others can harm one's pride, or loved ones �
         and some dangers can spark irrevocable change in a Hero's life, if
         allowed to bring their threat to bear.

          Challenges are characters, forces, and situations that pose a danger to the
          Heroes, their Quests, or their goals. Challenge profiles are prewritten
          collections of Threats & Consequences, tags, statuses, and Limits that
          best represent such characters. This chapter is a menagerie of ready-to-use
          Challenges you can use in scenes in your story.

104  --  LEGEND IN THE MIST - VOL . II - THE NARRATOR

Not Every NPC Is A Challenge

Only NPCs and situations that pose a threat to the Heroes, their
Quests, or their goals, are represented with a Challenge.

Most other NPCs do not need any game elements and exist for flavor,
drama, or as backdrop. Ally NPCs are typically represented by story
tags that the Heroes control. All such NPCs start using the Challenge
rules only if they become a threat: An NPC can be helpful at times
and present a Challenge at other times, or a vulnerable NPC might
need to be protected from danger, thereby becoming a Challenge (see
the Charge role, page 110).

Challenge Shorthand

A Challenge can be written as shorthand within a paragraph
describing a challenging situation, by simply mentioning tags,
statuses, and Limits (if any):

   The prince is beguiled-4 and won't listen to any ill talk
   about the wizard. (Quick outcome)

   The hefty oak door is barricaded-2 ; it will not be easy
   to break-down 4 .

   The people of the village are upset-3 and carrying
   pitchforks. If the situation boils-over 5 , they will
   attack and injure the imp and anyone protecting them
   (wounded-2) .

Conditions That Are Also Challenges                                           ascToeoflhlnntiHssdhiietectriiovoosueecnlsedanicsmaet,fruifoesaenstcsosttlsvautuenkhddeted.ietlpnitamlhyceei-ng

Statuses that progress on their own, such as drowning, suffocating, on-
fire, poisoned, sick (for severe ailments), or falling (for long falls), can
be Challenges on their own.

While a Hero is affected by such a status, you may present a Threat
such as "The poison spreads" or "You can't breathe", either before their
spotlight or before another Hero's spotlight ("Gerrin is drowning!
What do you do?").

If no action is taken to remove the status or to stop its progression,
deliver a Consequence increasing the status.

These statuses can have a Limit, which when maxed, changes their
tag or triggers an outcome. A Hero might be falling until impact 4 ,
and then they take broken-spine-6.

     Challenge Profiles And How To Use Them

     THREATS & CONSEQUENCES A

     A Challenge's Threats and Consequences are                                   E

     its most typical actions.

     � Read a Threat when you Establish the

     scene. This is the action the Challenge is

     beginning to take, prompting the Hero to

     take action to avoid or prevent the Threat                            B   A

     from materializing.

     � If a Threat is ignored, or if the Hero's action

     generates Consequences, read and apply one                            C
     or more of the related Consequences. These

     are the outcomes of the Challenge's action,

     or their response to the Hero's action.

     � Consequences written without a                                      D
       Threat are actions the Challenge might

     take when a Hero's actions generates

     Consequences, regardless of Threat.

     LIMITS B                                                                  wyYfCbtoohoeharutueyawiclHattleae,roeennearnogonndve1edee'ossrftaicctlninhlohsiemmdotineoaei6dstkneeaoLodeanfiCwmthamotiLnhtaaaisloemxl.etifnimIhltygfeu.erm,

     Limits (Vol. I, page 169) define when a Challenge is overcome
     by using Detailed outcomes. A Challenge without a Limit can be
     overcome with a Quick action.

     A Challenge with Limits is defeated when the Heroes give it the right
     type of status to max one of its Limits (the Narrator may still opt to
     resolve this Challenge with a Quick outcome for narrative reasons).
     Therefore, if the Challenge has a Limit, ask the players to use Detailed
     actions and spend their Power on giving it appropriate statuses.

     Some Limits are progress Limits (Vol. I, page 169) that build up
     towards a special outcome, such as a collapsing building, a transforming
     monster, or an ongoing ritual. The outcome is specified as a Special
     Feature below the Limit. When the Limit is maxed, apply the Special
     Feature as given.

     Immunities are Limits with no maximum ( � ) indicating a type
     of status the Challenge is immune to. When the Heroes give the
     Challenge such a status, reveal to them that it has no effect on it.

Story tags and statuses describe a Challenge's features and its
condition upon entering the scene. These represent only the
starting situation, and can be removed by players as normal, with
new ones given by you as Consequences (including recreating those
that were removed).

The purpose of these tags is primarily to affect the Heroes' actions
and reactions. Most tags and statuses are helpful to the Challenge
and hinder the Heroes, but some Challenges have tags for their
weaknesses, adding to the Power of a Hero's action.

Might describes the aspects in which this Challenge is Mighty and
the level of its Might. Use this to decide when a Hero's action could be
Favored or Imperiled.

Vulnerabilities, listed in parentheses after Might, indicate special
situations in which the Challenge's Might in this aspect is nullified
and considered Origin. This is not related to situations in which the
Heroes manage to use the Challenge's Might against it, which is
always an option.

SPECIAL FEATURES D

Special Features are rules unique to the Challenge, abilities that
cannot be expressed with Threats and Consequences, tags, statuses,
Limits, or Might. They mostly involve Consequences that can take
place at special times, such as before a Hero takes a certain action.

Every Special Feature has a condition (or `trigger', such as "When this
happens...") and an effect (outcome, such as "... do this."). Whenever
a Special Feature's condition is fulfilled, apply its effects, even if it
happens in the middle of a Hero's action.

CHALLENGE RATING AND ROLES E

A Challenge's role defines how it behaves in a scene (see a list of roles
on the next page).

A Challenge's rating, indicated with a number of markers ( )
between 1 and 5 next to its name, is a general indication of its difficulty
level. As a general rule, a Challenge with a greater rating will deliver
more grievous Consequences and be more difficult to overcome, either
due to its tags and statuses or because of higher Limits.

A Challenge's main Limit maximum is roughly equal to its rating,
while its main Consequence is often a status with a tier roughly
equal to its rating; these generalizations vary greatly, depending
on each Challenge's narrative, tags, statuses, and Special Features.
Consider also that Might dramatically sways the danger a
Challange's poses to the Heroes, if the Heroes are confronting it in
aspects where it is Mighty.

             HOMESTEAD & VILLAGE

            It's a dangerous business going out one's door, but even one's
         home can be dangerous enough! Family and friends sometimes fall
         out of favor, chatty oldtimers pry where they shouldn't, and there's

          always someone in the village who will boss you around or keep
          you from raiding the tavern's pantry. And that's not counting all

             the relationship and wounded their pride. Unfortunately, they're not over it.

              An Avoided Acquaintance seems to pop up when it's the least comfortable,
                 and make things awkward for the Hero by simply being around. They
                      can be avoided again � but this only postpones the inevitable.

Small communities tend to need little management. When disputes happen,
the locals look up to "elders" to resolve them. These can be official members

   of a town council, or simply a well-known, well-trusted head of family.

The magistrate was not born in these parts, and it shows. Although they may have lived here for
 many years, their air of authority, domineering attitude, and foreign customs do not fit the local
traditions and sensibilities. While they owe their power to a higher-ranking noble somewhere far

     away, in the village there's hardly anyone who can stand up to them and their word is law.

             themselves what happened that made the locals abandon it.

          The well can be haunted by a spirit, corrupted by evil forces, or
         simply poisoned � use the appropriate Threats & Consequence.

            A troublesome faerie spirit, common to barns, fields, and other lonely bucolic locales, the
         Boggart is an unwelcome guest and a supernatural pest. Its pranks and tricks might be funny,
          but such frivolities can turn dangerous in an instant. Folk wisdom suggests that addressing

              a Boggart directly by their name or fleeing during a prank will only make them angry.

Many witches live in proximity to rural settlements � close enough to offer
their services to villagers in need, and far enough to preserve their privacy.

   If met in a friendly setting or convinced to receive guests, the witch can
   offer to remove hexes, heal injuries or disease, or brew useful potions. If
someone slighted them, endangered something they care about, or otherwise
   stood in their way, they could resort to using magic against that person.

          The creaking caw of a raven can be an omen of a horrific fate to come. Unlike most
         birds, the Ominous Raven can speak. When it foretells the future, its words are clear

           and haunting, perhaps later recalled around the fireside � or evoking nightmares.

By foretelling a future event, the raven makes ominous Threats that hang over a Hero like a sword.

Bulls, cows, sheep, and goats often find themselves in trouble, having wandered
     out of their pens or gotten stuck on a hillside or in a ditch. Finding and

       GRABBING GNOME
                                          Sapper

    Pouncing out of the depths of a small cave or a tree trunk, this little
elderly Gnome literally attaches themself onto an unlucky passerby. The

   Gnome then drags along the ground, supernaturally heavy, a burden
   that slows their victim down to great annoyance and potential peril.

Some say the Gnome is actually a useful creature, with great insights into
  matters of craftsmanship. If only they were less irksome in every way.

  Be they demons that crawled out of the nether realms or cunning, twisted creatures full of malice, Reavers are
wiry and ferocious bipedal monsters who prowl the wild regions alone or in packs, laying waste to all in their path
and killing or despoiling for sport or for sustenance. They bow to no one, save those who prove more destructive.

Legends tell of a magnificent and terrifying raptor � a roc, griffin, drake, or perhaps a harpy � that has built
its nest in the region and feeds on roaming deer, bison, or yak. Those unfortunate enough to become its prey
are picked off the ground in one fell swoop and are carried off to its mountain perch, never to be seen again.

                into a rare charm � a pretty pearl or engraved stone � and guard it with their lives.

A massive obelisk stands defiant against the sky, wreathed in an unsettling atmosphere. This structure
   feels strange and, above all, dangerous. Tales about it abound, but its true meaning is lost to time.

       At some megalithic sites, evidence of worship can be found. Sometimes worshippers such as
           Hedge Witches (page 125) or Obsessive Cultists (page 163) surround the stone pillar.

                                                  Aggressor

 The Wrathwood Tree is a malevolent tree that grasps at passersby to drink their blood.
It may be that an evil spirit possessed a natural tree, or that one grew from a cursed seed.
It is often found where a tragedy occurred. The tree gives no warning signs to betray its

    nature; the only Threat is that of being in an eerie place, one demanding vigilance.

     Journey - Landscape

     Dark Forest

     Beneath a shadowed canopy stretching across the land stand trees hundreds
     of years old, steadfast against time � and you. You can hear animal cries, bird
     calls, branches creaking in the wind � and something else, bestial, far away.
     The smells of the forest are loamy and wet, and not a single stretch of ground
     is even, dry, or lacking in insects.

     Tags: shadows everywhere, wildlife, mysterious woods, thick foliage

     GENERAL CONSEQUENCES
        You (or a companion) wander too far off (lost-3).
        You step in a nettle patch, ant hill, or beehive (itching-2).
        The underbrush is sticky and prickly (gear gets sticky-1, torn-1, or scratch a tag).

         The water can carry you home, it can sweep you away, and it can
         pull you down to its sunless depths. Turbulent or calm, it lifts up
         ships that voyage across oceans and seas and gently laps against

            barges and rafts on glimmering lakes and wide meandering
         rivers. Do not fall for its deceiving song, for the water can be as

                                               Aggressor, Countdown

A tentacled behemoth, lurking beneath the waters, the Kraken is a legend known to sailors as one of the
   greatest dangers on the sea for its capacity to destroy entire ships and swallow their crews whole.

   Krakens are punishment from the gods, or perhaps creations of sorcerers of a past age. Their only
    weakness is a small magical pearl that is hidden between their tentacles, always kept underwater.

             With this pearl in hand, one can communicate with and even command the Kraken.

                                           Escape and swallow are polar statuses.

           along the shore or take on ships in open waters.

   Escape and catch are polar statuses. Escape hinders actions

Secretly, secretly, the cult of a dark sorcerer, evil spirit, or forgotten deity weaves its insidious web within
a community. When its followers throw off the cloak of deception, it is already too late. One can join them

       The Cultist's dark magic keeps them warded against both magic and physical harm, while their

There's no such thing as a casual night at the publick house, at least not when the Tavern Lark is
around. Ready to carouse the night away, this life-of-the-party is spreading mayhem for mayhem's

  sake, then making off with money and secrets. It's a just payment for the good times provided.

            The enjoying-myself status is compelling, to stay in the tavern and not go home.

This peculiar sorcerer marches gingerly onto the battlefield, leaving an acrid trail of smoke and

 engineer who most leaders rightfully fear will quickly turn into a loose cannon. Only the mad
    and the brave would carry such caustic and explosive concoctions into the chaos of war.

     In larger battles, the Bombardier may have access to siege weapons, such as a catapult.

A Soldier's Might can reflect their training (from local militia to experienced, well-armed
  mercenaries), their numbers ( a company or a great army), or both. Specific training,
     weapons, and provision can be reflected as tags (warhorse, morning-stars, disciplined).

                         A troop of Soldiers can be routed if their morale breaks.

         Dragons are among the most feared creatures in all of legend. Every dragon
            is unique: some have feathers, antlers, or even multiple heads, some are
            as large as mountains or castles, while others have serpentine, wingless

         forms. Many of them share a legendary greed, an infamous love of gold, and
           a ravenous hunger, that have brought these tyrannical creatures to hold

         entire kingdoms to ransom for fear of the dragon's wrath. Yet every dragon,
         even the most vile, has one item in its possession it holds dear over all other

            treasures � a magic ring, a simple token of love, or their unhatched egg.

     At long last, your journey has brought you to the throbbing heart of evil: a dark tower,
        a fortress of ice, or a sinister deity's hellish palace. You know, as you step through

     shadowy corridors, that all hope is lost and that you will perish here, yet your heart is
                set on your noble quest, and so you plunge deeper into the darkness.

                 it will be the last thing they see as free people, for the Tyrant's annihilating presence crushes

                      both body and soul, and restless death or eternal enslavement are all that awaits them.

                                                  Aggressor, Influence

Sequestered in their magical laboratory, this gifted sorcerer has fallen under the sway of a dark entity and
now seeks to do its bidding and spread its corrupting power. They blight the land, conjuring monstrosities

   and devilries that plague the common folk who dwell nearby. They are the subject of nursery rhymes,
   warning children to never approach their accursed abode, nor the malign demon that corrupted them.

     The Warlock possesses an item of power, a direct link to the corrupting entity (their beating heart,
 according to many tales). Without it, the Warlock's dark power is diminished and eventually gutters out.

                        Immortal Vampires rarely think of mortals as more than prey to be and hunted or
                      culled. Cultivators of wealth and power, they are part of the ruling class, hiding behind

                         pleasantries and enjoying vast holdings of land in which they may rule and feast.

      Vampires all have weaknesses, Vulnerabilities, and specific ways they can be put to eternal rest but these vary
     greatly from one vampire to another and the richness of folklore around them makes it hard to uncover the truth.

                                                        Influence, Aggressor

               An animated amalgam of stained glass, fused in the likeness of an angelic winged knight, the
           Stained Saint was formed out of sheer faith to defend the believers and battle heathens (according
          to the faith that formed it), even long after the followers dispersed and the belief has died out. These
         constructs haunt abandoned churches, ruined monasteries, and old graveyards, and some have grown

                 lonely or doubtful, and are therefore willing to debate the unbelievers, at least for a while.

                Being made of glass, the Saint is all but impervious to edged weapons such as sharp blades
                    and arrows. Its spiritual protection (warded) repels both mundane and magical harm.

  A gnarled mess of limbs, inanimate fastenings, corrupted flesh, and other profane materials woven
  together by ancient magic or unspeakable folk practices, Twisted Creations are made to serve and
protect the witch, cult, or sorcerer who made them. Their souls and minds just as cobbled together as
 their corporeal being, they are painfully aware of their own existence and are overwhelmed by fear,
confusion, hunger, and rage, and at times even love (or a mockery thereof), especially for their creator.

     Journey - Undertaking

     Crafting

     This Journey represents a process in which each Vignette
     is one more step toward completion. Unrelated scenes,
     and even entire adventures, could take place between the steps.

     A Hero usually decides to embark on a crafting project in order to achieve the final product,
     taking the initiative to engage with the Vignettes in order to gain an eventual benefit.
     This benefit is decided by the Narrator, and should be agreed upon with the player.
     Suggested Benefits: Represent the crafted item with a story tag, a story theme (Vol. I,
     page 165), or a new Possession or Relic theme (replace an existing one, Vol. I, page 192).

     GENERAL CONSEQUENCES
        You ruin some of your raw materials (scratch a tag for a material).
        Your work draws the attention of a mischievous spirit (New Challenge: House
        Hob, page 115, or Boggart, page 124).
        You grow tired-2 or frustrated-2 by the long hours and slow process.

     Journey - Undertaking

     Provisioning

     Time to stock up on fresh supplies, and buy some new equipment for your next
     adventure. Heading into the markets and side streets, you visit the shops and
     follow the shouts of street hawkers, looking for better deals.

     In this Journey, unlike most others, the Heroes might be allowed to choose which Vignette to
     approach and in which order, out of those offered by the Narrator. It typically ends when the
     Heroes have had enough, or when the Narrator deems the preparations complete. The Threat
     in many of the following Vignettes is the same: the merchant's attempt to get you to pay more.

     Suggested Benefits: Create story tags and/or story themes for several items; create a well-
     supplied status for the Fellowship.

     GENERAL CONSEQUENCES

        You pay the full price, which is quite a lot (short-on-coin-1).
        You and the merchant end up not seeing eye to eye (Blocked).
        You can only get low-quality items (add requires maintenance or breaks easily to
        an item tag).
        You reveal more about your plans than you intended to (Exposure).
        You hear some bad news about what's been going on down the road (Ill Tidings).

          The Heap-Thing
          Of Skunk Glen

         For as long as anyone can remember, at the
                         end of winter and before the spring festival,
                         the villagers of Ravenhome would cart
                         their old clothes, broken tools, and other
          discarded items and toss them over an outcrop of
          rock into a ravine known as Skunk Glen.

          One year, the Alderman convinced the others that
          they should change their custom � the rubbish and
          broken furniture could be piled high into a heap, and
          make a lovely bonfire for the spring festival!

the bottom of the glen, and when it heard it won't be
getting "new" clothes this year, it fumed and raged                           The piemaker's house
and swore to ruin this new spring festival. It made the                       is a mess � bubbling
pies rot and the broken tools come to life and beat the                       filling thickening in
villagers. With enchanted bonfire smoke and spring                            iron pots, empty crusts
melodies it beguiled the villagers to come to its lair                        cooling down on a long
in Skunk Glen, where it stole their tools, and shoes,                         wooden bench, and

STARTER ADVENTURE
The Heap-Thing of Skunk Glen is a starter adventure, designed to walk
you and your group through your first game of Legend In The Mist.
Before running it as a Narrator, it is suggested that you read through
it and refer to the rules mentioned within.

BACKGROUND

Every year at the end of winter, the villagers of Ravenhome

(see sidebar) perform the ceremony of Spring Renewal.

Every person � from child to elder � picks a few old items, such as
tattered clothes or tools broken beyond repair, and adds them to a
special cart that is then ceremoniously pushed over an outcrop of rock
into the Skunk Glen ravine. After that, a celebration is held in the
village green, sharing food, singing, and dancing around a big bonfire.
The old of the previous winter is sent off, and the new is welcomed.

CHANGING CUSTOMS
This year, however, Alderman Beaks has convinced the villagers that
rubbish and broken furniture can be better utilized as fuel for the
festive bonfire. He has his reasons (see the Rumors of What's to Come
below), but to the others he explains it thus: what better way to use
old, discarded things than to drive away the last cold of winter?

    RUMORS OF WHAT'S TO COME
Alderman Beaks is a wise man who would not go against a beloved,
established tradition without a good reason.

Recently he has heard, through traders and acquaintances, of a
growing number of bandits on the road, and of strangers roaming
about who harbor ill-intent. Troubled, he went to receive advice from
the village Wise One, and conversed with others in the community.

Eventually, the Alderman decided the villagers would be better served
reserving some of the logs ordinarily meant for the great festival
bonfire � to be used for fortification, if such a dire need arises. So, he
found an alternative source of fuel for the bonfire � the discarded items
themselves � unknowingly starting a feud with the Heap-Thing.

out loud to start things off:

  Although the last cold of winter is still felt in the air this
  morning, the people of Ravenhome are unusually active.
  There's a sweet sort of tension in the air � anticipation
  for the Spring Renewal celebration. Finally, it came
  around! It's tonight!

  Spring Renewal, being the first outdoor event after
  winter, is an opportunity to finally have some fun with
  all your loved ones, making merry under the open sky and
  bright stars. But first, there's work to be done: preparing
  food, setting tables, raking the village green, and more.

  One important job is to collect the clothes deemed too
  worn and the furniture deemed too broken to repair to the
  Discarded Cart. Every year, the contents of the cart are
  spilled over the edge of Skunk Glen to symbolize renewal.
  It's a Ravenhome tradition as old as the village itself, but
  you've heard rumors the tradition itself might go through
  a renewal this year.

  You dress up quickly, finish breakfast, and make your
  way to the center of the village. It's time to join in with
  the preparations.

Meeting At The Village Square

The village square is a muddy enclosure surrounded by houses and facing the
larger building of the village hall. From here, one only needs to take a few steps
outward to get a good look at almost anywhere in the village, which is why
Alderman Beaks is often found nearby.

The Alderman isn't here yet, but he has sent word to the Heroes to come, so he
can meet with them. How do they arrive? Let's play this scene using the game
loop (page 20).

ESTABLISH
Establish the scene by describing it, and let the Heroes know they all happen to
be here this morning (with some exceptions allowed). There are no immediate
Challenges or Threats, and the stakes of the scene are yet to be revealed.

ACTION
Choose a Hero to take action first. Have them describe how they arrive at the
scene, what they look like, what they say or do, and how they respond to the
excitement in the village. These are all Simple actions (Vol. I, page 150), so no
need to roll the dice yet.

Heroes can see or hear each other and lend a hand if one gets into
trouble.                                                                   amhpttaiHtAtSlufhhhrrlbusiecluysetoeeanirkpihlhawstinot.awtaaeeepgBpyrfryotprs,apeehirustswriccctktoelfuosoahamaiocoapuurniorr�scfrlneddtwueitsdaoi,aiehstripdesdttgaotesriecajisaunpusuviMhcnbklptpesdSooaeetelorevitaitnrnmre,eahnshnidrQeninepaoeadfemlugriwtemtramts.ihuhcmhcsaaWaaorkytecanlcatlieyitaoiatglskrtitnicitwolefthohcleton-naiotbitrisr2souolhahcntieoed.s.s,re

ESTABLISH
Each task is a Challenge for a Hero to contend with, with its
details listed below. Describe the Challenge to the Hero, present its
inherent Threat, and clarify the stakes of their particular task.

ACTION
For each action, use a Quick outcome (Vol. I, page 151):
� Ask the Hero to describe their action.

� Ask them to count the action's Power. Each chore Challenge
  listed below has tags and/or statuses that could help or hinder
  certain actions � let the Hero know about those when they
  become relevant.

� The Hero rolls the dice and adds their Power. Rolling 7 or more
  is a Success, and rolling 9 or less leads to Consequences.

A Success means the Challenge has been overcome and the chore
was completed, but if the Hero did not achieve a Success, they
may try again when they have the spotlight.

CONSEQUENCES
Each task Challenge listed below has its own Consequences.
If a Hero ignores the Threat posed by the Challenge (such
as by throwing up their hands and leaving, or approaching
the Challenge without caution) or if their action generates
Consequence, choose one or more Consequences to deliver.

If it has an Effect, write it on a tracking card and give it to the
Hero or add it into the scene.

Allow the Hero to make a reaction roll to lessen the Effects
of a Consequence (Vol. I, page 162), using reactive tags. Tags
already invoked in the action cannot be used again.

REPEAT
Move from Hero to Hero and Establish their individual
situations, allow them to take Action, and deliver Consequences
as needed.

Once all the tasks are finished � or botched � the day has
wrapped up and the celebration begins. Continue on to Bedlam
on the Green (page 216).

DETAILED ACTIONS

Many of the Threats posed by Challenges in this
scene can be averted with a Quick action. The
same is true for actions uncovering the bonfire as
the cause of the problem.

However, the main Challenge, the Cursed Bonfire,
requires the Heroes to take Detailed actions (Vol.
I, page 151) and add a quenched, choked, or wet
status against the bonfire's put-out Limit.

Where appropriate, allow the Heroes to take Detailed
actions and spend their Power on Effects such as
removing delirious statuses or creating a helpful tag.

        singing too loudly, and dancing with abandon, knocking into each other without care for safety or decorum.

THE DELIRIOUS
PROCESSION

  "Is everyone here?" "Have you seen where Yarni has
  gone?" "What have they done to the banners!"...

  In all the commotion around, with people gathering and
  looking distraught, one shout can be heard clearly above the
  rest: "There! Someone's going down the Skunk Glen path!"

  It's true � several torchlights dance in the darkness along
  the ravine's edge, going down the infamous path that leads
  to its bottom. The Glen path is treacherous even during
  day time, and there is scarcely any reason to go down it.

  Cries for attention are left unanswered, as the travellers
  keep making their way downward. Suddenly, one of the
  torches falls into the darkness... Everyone watching from
  the green gasps in distress.

In this scene, the Heroes make their way down to the Bottom of Skunk
Glen alongside several of the villagers who were enchanted early on
during the festival and are heading down to join the Heap-Thing's party.

The glen path zigzags for a while down the hillside and ends just under
the rock outcropping that juts out of the village green by an enormous,
rotting pile of discarded items from decades, perhaps centuries, of the
Spring Renewal tradition: the entrance to the creature's lair.

        A strong wind blows out the torch

        A Hero slips over a mossy rock or down
        a rubble pile (scraped-2 or scratch a tag of

LET YOUR CREATIVITY LEAD YOU
You don't have to use the Oracle. Whenever you are faced with a choice
or with the need to come up with new details (a scene, a Challenge,
a development), you can always use your imagination, creativity,
storytelling flair, reasoning, and so on, in order to decide how the story
unfolds.

LET THE STORY LEAD YOU
You're not limited by the outcomes of the oracle. If the fiction already
sparks some ideas in your mind about what's coming, or if the Oracle's
answer doesn't quite fit your current situations, go with your own vision
of the narrative.

Keeping a Journal

Using a journal (or other written record) can help you keep track of all
that has happened in your story, especially over long solo journeys.
Whenever something moves the story along, write a sentence or two in
your journal. You can highlight or underline tags and statuses to make
them easier to track.

There is no right or wrong way to keep an adventure journal. You
can write it in the voice of your Hero, the Narrator, or even another
character in the story witnessing your Hero's actions. Your journal can
contain more than just words; sketch, draw maps, or do anything else
that brings your story to life.

You can incorporate your journal into your actions. Whenever your
Hero acts, write a description of the action in your journal in a sentence
or two. When counting Power, tags and statuses only count if you
include them in the description of your action.

The Individual Oracles

The Oracle consists of seven parts:

� The Question Oracle, used to receive a yes/no answer or a conceptual
  answer

� The Conflict Oracle, used to discover the details of the next scene,
  adventure, or series

� The Premade Profile Oracle, used to pick at random a Challenge
  Profile from this book

� The Profile Builder, used to generate a custom Challenge Profile on
  the fly

� The Challenge Action Oracle, used to discover a Challenge's next action
� The Consequence Oracle, used to discover Consequences to the

  Hero's action
� The Revelations Oracle, used when playing a Mountain-style series
